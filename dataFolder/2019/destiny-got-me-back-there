Text: "I had visited Germany in 2012 on a holiday . I was then employed by Emirates\
  \ airlines in Mumbai .My sister lives there . My first ever foreign trip .The moment\
  \ I landed in Frankfurt airport my heart wishperd I should be working here .It was\
  \ my dream .Then I took a train to Stuttgart and the city looked soo familiar .\
  \ Every year I travelled there to meet her .From 2012 to 2014 .we explored lots\
  \ of cities together .Had lot of fun with her friends and locals around .Stayed\
  \ in different hostels .\n\n\n   In 2016 I was looking for a guy to settle down\
  \ .Destiny pairs me with the guy from Stuttgart itself .we never met before .But\
  \ he's been working there from long time .Ours was a arranged marriage n lill did\
  \ I know I would be going back to the same city as a resident .\n\nWe got married\
  \ and I moved there in June 2016 .My sister also lives in the same city .It was\
  \ like a dejavu movement for me .I did not know the language .I took one and a half\
  \ year to learn the language .Travelled to many places with my husband .\n\n\n \
  \ After 2 years he got transfer and moved to a city called Mainz .close to Frankfurt\
  \ .Destiny bought me close to Frankfurt Airport .I did not want to miss this chance\
  \ and applied for a job at American airlines.To my surprise I got the job and started\
  \ working there .It was a dream come true for me .\n\n\n   Some times life takes\
  \ you back to ur dreams and gives you a chance to relive them or make the most of\
  \ what you can .\n \n     Now we are back to India for short term .This is my story\
  \ .I believe in destiny and magic ."
