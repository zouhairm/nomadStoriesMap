Text: "\u201CThis is Alex, she\u2019s here to teach English.\u201D I\u2019m introduced\
  \ to yet another friendly-faced relative of my host mother - maybe a cousin once\
  \ removed. I no longer try to remember what the relationship is; the game of who\u2019\
  s who got too complex a long time ago. She has the concerned look of someone unsure\
  \ how to start a conversation with a \u2018gringo\u2019, a foreigner like me. I\u2019\
  m told this word originates from the hopeful command, \u201CGreen, go!\u201D, shouted\
  \ at the green-uniformed US military when they ventured south of the imaginary Trump\
  \ wall. By now, the hesitance of my host family\u2019s friends and family is familiar\
  \ to me. After all, what do you ask someone about whom you know nothing apart from\
  \ the distance between you? Almost as a nervous habit, my host mother quickly adds,\
  \ \u201CShe\u2019s vegan\u201D, to avoid the anticipated awkward silence. The routine\
  \ shock, horror and offence quickly flash across my new acquaintance\u2019s face.\
  \ Did I mention I was in Argentina \u2013 meat capital of the world?\n\nIt became\
  \ apparent that being vegan would be a problem when I received an email from my\
  \ first host family with the fateful words, \u201CWe need to talk\u201D. Were they\
  \ breaking up with me before I had even arrived? No. They heroically accepted me\
  \ despite my strange habit.\nI first met my host family after being peeled off a\
  \ sticky five-hour coach ride. I was greeted by two excited, nervous parents, and\
  \ two reluctant kids - one incessantly playing with his Rubik\u2019s cube, the other\
  \ avoiding eye contact. They drove me to my new home, where we sat outside on their\
  \ modern, white-tiled porch, along with their three scruffy, overexcited dogs. As\
  \ we began introductions, the sunny garden was filled with laughter when I asked\
  \ what breed the dogs were. All dogs in this town come from the streets and only\
  \ the most persistent are adopted. These dogs don\u2019t expect pedigree food, they\
  \ enjoy their human\u2019s leftovers. I felt sorry for them, knowing that they were\
  \ about to be disappointed by my green foods filling their bowls for the next few\
  \ months.\n\nI had dared to arrive in the land of steak with no appetite for their\
  \ sacred meat-filled barbecues - the \u2018asado\u2019 - nor their gloopy, sweet\
  \ Dulce de Leche. More awkward still, I had been placed in Trenque Lauquen, home\
  \ of the largest milk factory in the country. The large metal machinery whispered\
  \ naughty, dairy-filled thoughts to me as I cycled to work every day.\n\nAs the\
  \ inquisition into my refusal of dairy and meat developed, I realised the magnitude\
  \ of the problem; they genuinely thought I was putting myself at risk of malnutrition.\
  \ I am not new to this sentiment. But I started to get irritated every time I was\
  \ asked \u201Cwhy?\u201D and \u201Cbut what do you eat?\u201D. I felt guilty knowing\
  \ that my host families were having to buy expensive vegan-friendly foods for me,\
  \ especially amid an economic crisis. After a month, I forgot why I ever chose this\
  \ lifestyle. With no support for this choice in my new community it was hard to\
  \ stay motivated or remember images of chicks having their beaks chopped off. I\
  \ wanted to know what Alfajores, biscuits oozing with Dulce de Leche, tasted like.\
  \ I wanted to experience the sweet-flavoured culture of Argentina. \n\nMy inner\
  \ debate continued until one fateful day, I gave in. I walked into a supermarket\
  \ knowing my intention. I would be leaving with an Alfajor and the end of my vegan\
  \ problems in Argentina.\n\nAs I walked home, ashamed, defeated, my mouth adjusting\
  \ to the exuberant sugar level, I wondered whether to keep up the pretence with\
  \ my host family. Would they think me weak? Would they resent the last month of\
  \ cuisine-induced torture? My pride overruled reason and I became a clandestine\
  \ regular at the corner shop, choosing a different flavour of Alfajor each time.\
  \ My secret, at first thrilling, soon felt childish and egocentric. It was time\
  \ to confess.\n\nWhat was I greeted with as I finally admitted my treachery? Squeals\
  \ of delight. They didn\u2019t seem too surprised though; maybe it had something\
  \ to do with the unknown whereabouts of several biscuits from their cupboard\u2026\
