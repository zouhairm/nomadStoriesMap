Text: "Graduated high school from Palestine when I was 16 years old then decided to\
  \ get shipped off to the United States without knowing anyone or anything about\
  \ where I was going and what I was getting myself into. \nFlight was long, but through\
  \ the entire journey all I could I think off was whether or not I will find people\
  \ that will replace my people I left in Palestine, a war torn country full of obstacles,\
  \ full of sorrow, but yet full of love. \nFirst week was tough, I was still trying\
  \ to connect with people, how do I connect with students that don\u2019t talk my\
  \ language, don\u2019t eat my food and don\u2019t know anything about my country.\
  \ I then decided to know about theirs. \nI made a choice of traveling and trying\
  \ to visit as many states as I could. From country club in Tennessee to beaches\
  \ in California. Every state I\u2019ve been to has been different: California was\
  \ sunny yet it rains, Colorado was full of energetic people even when it snows,\
  \ DC was all wrapped in politics yet people were full of hope, Florida brought me\
  \ back to my young self, Kansas was green, and so was Missouri, Nevada was liveful,\
  \  New Jersey and New York reminded me of home and all the traffic that is in a\
  \ person\u2019s life, North Carolina has all seasons at the same time, Oregon was\
  \ pure, had my first philly cheese steak in Pennsylvania, Tennessee was a different\
  \ vibe and experience, Texas was full of boots and hats, Virginia was my home for\
  \ four years, and finally, Washington opened my eyes on the possibility of having\
  \ it all. I haven\u2019t been able to travel as much as I wanted outside the states,\
  \ but I hope this opportunity can give me that."
