Text: "Windows down, Toto on repeat, factor 50 lathered on, and the open road ahead...\
  \ Yes, I had arrived in Africa! \nBut unlike Toto's 'Africa' there was no rain to\
  \ be seen or felt - not for a while at least. I was on a 5 week overland tour from\
  \ Nairobi, Kenya to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and it was 36\xB0. My daily motto was\
  \ \"I'm too Irish for this shit!\" And I was! I mean, I only need to look at the\
  \ sun for it to take a fancy to me and decide it's my new best friend/grade A clinger.\
  \ But I was in Africa, not Ireland, and this Dorothy had to adapt...fast! So I did\
  \ what you're supposed to do in such heated conditions and drank plenty of water...\
  \ Which of course only lead to numerous toilet stops along the way, with nobody\
  \ wanting to be the person who actually pressed the buzzer to let the driver know\
  \ when to stop. \nNow, toilet stops in Africa are very different to toilet stops\
  \ back home where you pull in to a service station or pub and ask to use the loo.\
  \ When you need to go in Africa, and you're only a couple of hours into a 9 hour\
  \ journey, you learn to get over yourself. Everyone hops off the truck and disperses\
  \ in all directions - boys on one side of the road, girls on the other - each vying\
  \ for their own little bit of privacy behind whatever bush you can find and hope\
  \ no one is looking. \n\"TIA\" our guide had laughed when we were all new and naive\
  \ - This Is Africa! \nBut by the third or fourth day we got into the swing of things,\
  \ and no one was all that modest after that. Needs must, you know? \nI had never\
  \ pitched a tent in my life, which at 33 probably isn't something to boast about,\
  \ but we don't exactly get great camping weather in Ireland so I'm just going to\
  \ use that as my excuse. The Irish love blaming the weather for everything! \nIt\
  \ took a couple of attempts, figuring out which pole slotted in where, but once\
  \ it was up, it was like a mini victory! I had physically put a roof over my head\
  \ for the night and it was a lovely feeling! That first night, I didn't sleep -\
  \ mostly because I was too hot, but also, I could see the stars twinkling in the\
  \ sky when I looked out my tent window. It was a surreal realisation that I was\
  \ in Africa, (not exactly) sleeping under the stars in a tent I had put up by myself.\
  \ Like, seriously! \nThere were 26 of us on the tour, with people getting off and\
  \ on in different places. I was the only Irish amongst a group of Americans, Canadians,\
  \ Swedish, British, Swiss, Spanish and Belgian. There was never a dull moment, but\
  \ everyone pulled together and got on famous. Even when it came to meal times, we\
  \ took it in turns so there was always something different on the menu. \nThe days\
  \ were long, but the scenery was something else. Africa, in parts, was a lot greener\
  \ than what I had imagined. The people are the friendliest you'll ever meet, always\
  \ smiling and welcoming, and curious I suppose. They might not have much in terms\
  \ of possessions, but they make up for it in warmth and kindness. They're happy\
  \ as they are. I came away from the trip a lot more thankful for what I have. We\
  \ complain about the silliest things. And why? It's the little things that are important\
  \ - it's having a smile and a kind word for everyone, it's holding the door open\
  \ for someone, it's being open minded, it's remembering you're only a tiny little\
  \ fish in a really big pond. Traveling...it really does broaden the mind. It's humbling.\
  \ It enables you to push past your comfort zone and explore new places, and try\
  \ new things. And along the way, you'll meet wonderful new people, and make the\
  \ best memories to carry with you forever.\nThank you, Africa. You blew me away\
