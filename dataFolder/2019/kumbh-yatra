Text: "KUMBH YATRA\nUjjain, M.P.(Madhaya pradesh), India\n\nIntroduction:-\nI am discussing\
  \ here one of my most memorable trip that left their indelible impression on my\
  \ mind.\nSo here I start, the trip called \u201CKumbh Yatra\u201D. Before discussing\
  \ about the trip I would let you know the meaning of kumbh. According to indian\
  \ mythology of Bhagavat purana, it is said that during the churning of ocean, there\
  \ were seven jewel found from ocean in which one jewel that is called \u2019Amrit\u2019\
  . For this Amrit Devta(deity) and Danav(devil) fought from each other than lord\
  \ Vishnu took the responsibility to deal out that Amrit equally in both the groups(Devta\
  \ and Danav).\nDuring this assignment a drop of Amit fell down on some places of\
  \ earth and that  day, time and date was registered, so whenever  time repeats due\
  \ to position of sun and stars motion and creates the same date and day according\
  \ to hindu calendar is celebrated as \u2018Kumbh\u2019 and the complete circumstances\
  \ named as \u2018Kumbh Mela\u2019.\n\nExperience:- \nI\u2019am sharing here my experiences\
  \ of Ujjain Kumbh. Ujjian is a city which is situated at Madhaya Pradesh state in\
  \ India. It is also called the city of \u2018Mahakal\u2019(lord Shiv).\nIt is said\
  \ that the Shivling of Mahakal situated here from the beginning of era.\nThere are\
  \ four places in India where Kumbh organized- Ujjain, Nashik, Haridwar and Allahabad.\n\
  In Kumbh yatra, Snan(take a bath) in the river is most important part because according\
  \ to mythology that Amrit fell down in the river. I started with the Kumbh Snan\
  \ in Kshipra river with my mother and then we followed  some rituals as Deep Daan\
  \ and worship of river. After these rituals we leave for Mahakal darshan. This is\
  \ my first time when I was going to see that prior Shivling. I was very excited.\
  \ I entered in the temple with the mob and the mob of people acclaim \u2018Har Har\
  \ Mahadev\u2019 again and again, it feels like every single particle of environment\
  \ melted with the sound of \u2018Har Har Mahadev\u2019. After some hours and rushing\
  \ with the mob of the peoples finally I saw that shivling and it is unforgettable\
  \ that I can see again and again whenever I close my eyes. It is said that the everyday\
  \ makeup of shivling is different, it never be repeated and this is also one of\
  \ the world\u2019s famous fact of this temple.\nThere is another part of Kumbh i.e.\
  \ called \u2018Aakhadas\u2019 of saint. Aakhadas are places those allocated to different\
  \ saints, belongs from a particular area and community like Nagababa Aakhada, Kinnar\
  \ Aakhada, Tantric (black magician) Aakhada and many more. \nI visited to some Aakhadas\
  \ where I saw different levels of devotion and austerities of saints. Some of saints\
  \ are totally naked in Nagababa aakhada and they painted ash on their body and chanting\
  \ for Lord Shiv. Some were stand on a single leg in the position of \u2018Vrakshasan\u2019\
  \ for many years and chanting for Mahadev (Shiv). One of saint lay down in sharp\
  \ edges bush, there were many sage with their different yoga positions in the state\
  \ of concentration. These all their own ways, they choose for showing their passion\
  \ and devotion towards their lord.\nAnd at last in the evening the whole day mesmerized\
  \ memories going to add another one, the sandhaya aarti of Kshipra river. In which\
  \ thousands of lamps float together in the river and hindu  priest worship one of\
  \ the most powerful, humble and essential gift from the nature (kshipra river).\n\
  In hindu mythology most of rituals learn us that we should be thankful to Almighty\
  \ and the nature whatever they give us for our life.\n\nConclusion :-\nI think all\
  \ the trips in our life completely connected to the nature and their native culture.\
  \ This \u2018Kumbh yatra\u2019 is complete package about nature and native culture.\n\
  At last, I am very thankful to world nomads for giving such an amazing platform\
  \ where my kind of aspirants meet with their hidden talent of writing.\n\nThank\
  \ you\nAnkita Rai"
