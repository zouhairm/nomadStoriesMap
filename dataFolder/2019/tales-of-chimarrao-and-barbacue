Text: "My travel experience was in my own homeland, but living in one as large as\
  \ Brazil, crossing from North to South can take longer than going to the nearest\
  \ country. I had been to a few Brazilian states and cities, but this was my first\
  \ time going to the South region. We took a flight to Porto Alegre, the capital\
  \ of Rio Grande do Sul, and a couple of friends picked us up at the airport. It\
  \ was almost lunch time and we were quite hungry, so the couple took us to their\
  \ home. When we arrived there, we could smell the barbacue from the street. The\
  \ house was crowded with their entire family and there was so much food it seemed\
  \ like a feast! You could think a vegetarian wouldn\u2019t fit in, but I was very\
  \ surprised to see that the Southerns eat their meat with a lot of salad (the complete\
  \ opposite from my own people; the main dish on the Northern culinary is fish and\
  \ rice or cassava flour). Those strangers who had never seen us before immediately\
  \ welcomed us into their lunch and conversations, and the second thing that intrigued\
  \ me the most was that while they ate, they also drank chimarr\xE3o, a hot infused\
  \ drink. I, being a fan of tea, loved the chimarr\xE3o. I never thought meat and\
  \ tea would be a good combination, but surprisingly it was! The members of the family\
  \ and friends share the same cuia (the recipient where they drink the chimarr\xE3\
  o from) and the same bomba (a kind of silver straw); it goes from one hand to another\
  \ while they talk or hang out. There\u2019s also a game the locals do with the tourists:\
  \ if this is your first time drinking chimarr\xE3o, you need to drink it all until\
  \ the cuia is empty! When it\u2019s finished, the bomba makes a sound like a snore,\
  \ so they call it \u201Cmake the cuia snore\u201D.\nAfter spending the rest of the\
  \ day in Porto Alegre, we started our road trip in the next morning. The smaller\
  \ cities on the countryside were completely different from the capital, because\
  \ there is still a strong presence and proud of their European roots. Sometimes\
  \ I could swear I was in Germany or The Netherlands, while still being in my own\
  \ tropical country; but it was amazing to see that, wherever the locals went, they\
  \ would take their cuias and a large bottle containing hot water to drink the chimarr\xE3\
  o wherever they were. It was even better that you could find it anywhere and they\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be disgusted to share their drink with you, even if you had just\
  \ met. I realized it was a great way to bond, and everyone was so friendly and interested\
  \ in hearing our stories, considering we came from a completely different place.\
  \ \nNowadays, when I\u2019m home and eating meat, I remember those days and think\
  \ that having some chimarr\xE3o would be a good idea; but then I remember something\
  \ I heard from a Southern lady: the drink is only good when you have friends to\
  \ share it with."
