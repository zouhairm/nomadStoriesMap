Text: "Walking out of the metro station and taking my first glimpse of Barcelona sent\
  \ shivers of excitement from my head to my toes. I was finally on my way to seeing\
  \ Europe after a three-month study abroad program in England. It was a beginning\
  \ of a new adventure, but little did I know it would also be the end. \nI was walking\
  \ down the streets to my hostel when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I thought it was\
  \ a friendly greeting and I turn my head around. Two guys were passing by, and before\
  \ I could reply, one guy told me \u201CYour backpack is open.\u201D I paused in\
  \ place while a million thoughts flitted through my brain. At the moment, I felt\
  \ like the world was crashing down on top of me. Frantically, I take my backpack\
  \ off to see if it was true and whether I can rectify this issue, and of course,\
  \ it was wishful thinking. \nI might have been fortunate that I was not harmed or\
  \ confronted by a dangerous criminal, but I have lost my passport, identification\
  \ cards, credit/debit cards, and one hundred five U.S. dollars in a foreign country.\
  \ Fortunately, I placed some euros into another pocket and still had my electronics.\
  \ I knew I would not be able to take back what was lost, so I went to the hostel\
  \ that I had a reservation at. I did not know if I would be able to stay at the\
  \ hostel without money so I thought I would be kicked out. With my hands shaking\
  \ and voice wavering, I asked the receptionist if I could use the wifi to call my\
  \ family, block my bank account, and call the U.S. embassy. Since I could not pay\
  \ up-front at the moment, I honestly thought I would be kicked out without being\
  \ able to use the wifi. Fortunately, my assumption was wrong. Not only did the hostel\
  \ let me use the wifi, they helped me print out the documents for an emergency passport\
  \ and allowed me to stay until I could get my credit/debit card in the mail.\nI\
  \ kept looking over my shoulders and checking my pockets multiple times while going\
  \ out the next couple of days. I could have stayed at the hostel the whole time\
  \ being sensitive and suspicious of the people around me, but the people I encountered\
  \ were encouraging and offered to help in any way they could. I had people offer\
  \ me some money and advice on where I could find food. Others offered to join me\
  \ on my trip to the police station and the U.S. embassy. At first, I was hesitant\
  \ when they offered to help, but they told me something that expanded my perspective.\
  \ They said, \u201C If anyone was in the same situation, I would offer to help because\
  \ someone out there would do the same for me.\u201D\nNow that I look back on my\
  \ trip to Barcelona, I did not expect to find kindness and generosity. Kindness\
  \ is not an alien concept, but I am more familiar with a expect-something-in-return-for-helping\
  \ kind of mentality and not the goodness-out-of-one\u2019s-heart. I most likely\
  \ will make similar mistakes as I continue traveling to other countries, but I learned\
  \ that everything will be alright in the end because there would also be kind-hearted\
  \ people out there willing to lend a hand. If I had not met them, I would have considered\
  \ giving up all thoughts of traveling again because of fear. However, they have\
  \ taught me that going abroad does have its risks but it shouldn\u2019t stop anyone\
  \ from exploring a different country or give up meeting new people."
