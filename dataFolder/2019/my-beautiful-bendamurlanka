Text: "One fine morning I receive a call from my Mother asking me to visit our village\
  \ once to attend local Festival. Due to work, life becomes too busy and I don't\
  \ have any time to think about my hometown. In sake of featival, I got chance to\
  \ escape from this headaches! I started my journey to my beautiful village called\
  \ Bendamurlanka from Mumbai, India by train. It was 26 hours journey, so I book\
  \ sleeper coach and started my journey.\n\nI doze slightly and remembering my childhood\
  \ days.\n\nI was born and spent most of my childhood in Bendamurlanka, a village\
  \ famous for greenery. It locates on the bank of river Godavri in India. In our\
  \ village 90% of people depends upon Farming and Irrigation. So I spent most of\
  \ my leasure time in paddy fields and coconut farms. For Irrigational purposes farmers\
  \ use brooks to store water beside paddy fields. I used to sat on that brink to\
  \ enjoy that greenery & sceneary by keeping my legs into that water. Sometimes my\
  \ dad joins me there with some fresh coconut water and started telling me about\
  \ his childhood days and teach me some life lessons. Small fishes cames to me to\
  \ eat dead skin on my legs (when I came to city i came to know that's called fish\
  \ pedicure) According me, that was the best childhood one can get! In middle of\
  \ 10 acare green fields, sitting on brink beside a little pond full of lotus, little\
  \ tickling fishes a friendly dad teaching me life lessons.. A Wonderful childhood!\
  \ Sometimes I sat there and read Rabindranath tagore's Geethanjali book!\n\nI still\
  \ remember that day when My Dad takes me to a Beach which is 3 kilometers away from\
  \ my Home on Full Moon night! We both sat on shore and started singing songs on\
  \ full moon. After that we watch rabbits in that moonlight.. that was my life time\
  \ experience!\n\nWe have very simple life style in our village, used to wake up\
  \ early morning by 5 'o clock and brush our tooth with some fresh charcoal and neem\
  \ twigs, heating our bathing water in copper pots, etc. \nAt 6 'o clock me and my\
  \ dad go for walking to banks of River Godavari and watch sun raise there in every\
  \ morning. There is a small road in middle of paddy fields enroute to that banks.\
  \ Sometimes we see some snakes in fields. My dad always makes me courageous to control\
  \ them! There is a field located in middle of that view surrounded by coconut farm.\
  \ Slowly Sun cameout above from that coconut plants, his rays were fallen into paddy\
  \ fields and they appears in golden colour. I watch those eye ful moments every\
  \ morning! After that we take home fresh milk from our Manga (our very own Buffalo)\
  \ from farm. My mom makes tasty coffee with that milk. (In our village every farmer\
  \ treet their farm animals like family) Meanwhile my mother do watering for some\
  \ vegitable plants in our home garden and get us fresh veggies from that garden.\
  \ While coming to home in winter foggy mornings, I felt some fresh aroma of champa\
  \ flowers from our garden. After all these things I go to school and waiting for\
  \ evening times. \n\nAfter coming from school, I used to play with my cousins and\
  \ at 5.30 pm my dad takes me to Godavari to watch Sunset there. Sun goes down from\
  \ the edge of that River by shading red coloured rays on water waves and create\
  \ mild dusk colours on sky!\n\nAfter that we came to home, by having dinner we go\
  \ to our home terrace  to watch Moon and stars. My father used to tell lot of stories\
  \ at that time and I don't know when did I slept and I always wokeup on my bed every\
  \ morning!\n\nMy phone started ranging, It's a call from my Mother! I came out from\
  \ my childhood. I was near to my village.\n\nBy remembering all those memories in\
  \ past tense, I forgot about present tense, if I do this for some time.. I will\
  \ miss my village stop in future tense!!"
