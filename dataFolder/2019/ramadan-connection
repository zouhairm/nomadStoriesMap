Text: "In my journey from Brazil to Russia to work as a Media volunteer in the World\
  \ Cup I had twelve hours of transit in a connecting flight in Casa Blanca, a seaside\
  \ city in Morocco, Africa. There, Muslims celebrated Ramadan in May and June, the\
  \ same period which I coincidentally had half of the day to explore. \n\nNot aware\
  \ of where to go and with few resources, I decided to talk to a local merchant;\
  \ he owned a newsstand near the airport. There I bought some postcards of Hassan\
  \ II mosque and we started to talk about football, cheerfully he mentioned his love\
  \ for Raja Casablanca team. Looking at my postcard he said that I should get the\
  \ underground train that would lead me to the center of Casa Blanca and close to\
  \ the Hassan II Mosque. I exchanged dollars for the local currency, Dirham, and\
  \ I took the train, which was all covered with sand brought by the wind. \n\nAfter\
  \ about one hour I was at Hassan II mosque, a holy and sacred ground for many people.\
  \ There, some of them were praying, other walking in short steps, their respect\
  \ and honor for their belief could be felt in the wind. Then, I asked a couple to\
  \ take a picture of me and soon we started talking, they were very friendly, a man\
  \ named Zachariah, was with his fianc\xE9e, Zine Khadija, and his brother, the teenager,\
  \ Hadissan. They all were wearing long garments and flat shoes. Zine, as a woman,\
  \ was wearing her hijab. Very attentive to me, they took many photos and they even\
  \ asked me if we could take a selfie together. We talked for an hour, we had such\
  \ a vivid culture exchange. They were curious about my journey and Hadissan, as\
  \ a football fan, was eager to know more about my trip to the World Cup. \nAs we\
  \ walked through the mosque, all patterned in gold color details; they were surprised\
  \ I had not known anything in the city, but the mosque, hotel and airport. Therefore\
  \ they ask me to take part in the Ramadan fellowship in their house. I accepted\
  \ it.\nThere, I faced a big door in the entrance as the mosque\u2019s. Their flat\
  \ shoes were left in the front door, as well mine. A family of many children all\
  \ gathered in a large house greeted me, they were all in their robes, both women\
  \ and men, the house all colored by the light-green prints, there was a lot of their\
  \ typical food of the region, such as dates, couscous, kefta and juices of various\
  \ flavors, like mango mixed with orange, the family's favorite, were all on the\
  \ table, which was low, pretty close to the floor. We all sat in a ground sofa,\
  \ which brought a sense of belonging to that land and unity in the midst of our\
  \ differences. The abundance was not only in terms of food, their affection and\
  \ hospitality involved me, they were very charismatic, they listen to me, about\
  \ my culture, my country, respecting my origin and my wave length. They gave me\
  \ a bowl filled with local sweets and dates as a present, they took me to the airport\
  \ and the brother of the bridegroom Zachariah, Hamissan, gave me a small sculpture\
  \ of Allah.\n\nThat Half of the day was gone; I couldn\u2019t have known more of\
  \ the monarchic country, too rich in stories, customs and culture. However I was\
  \ ready to departure for a new adventure in Russia, because I made, in this connecting\
  \ flight in Morocco, another sort of connection, a deeper and more valuable one."
