Text: "Sitting on a park bench in Ireland listening in (per usual) on conversations\
  \ had behind the back of my head as couples and families and friends pass. Judgments\
  \ and opinions and shared loves and dislikes and cheerful attempts to make light\
  \ of the world without diminishing the subject of discussion. I look ahead at the\
  \ river lee, it\u2019s 3:15 in the afternoon and I'm lingering in the park before\
  \ footing it home to practice guitar and memory the dha-diri-diri patterns O'Byron\
  \ taught today in class. Listening to his ringing foreboding warnings in my head\
  \ that fit my shoes well\u2026 the master's student who may fall behind very quickly\
  \ with her demeanor. I remember Joseph sending Anne and me flowers in India, while\
  \ he was still in California. What a man she\u2019s caught there. He\u2019ll grow\
  \ well I expect if his father\u2019s expectations.. sink or swim she said. \n\t\
  He sent me roses with the message that she\u2019s quite lovely but she\u2019s got\
  \ some nasty thorns. If you can move past them her sweetness is there. He was more\
  \ than right that one and today my thorns were perturbed more than usual\u2026 Spikey\
  \ defense against my colleagues and standards that my mind refuses to submit to.\
  \ The river is looking beautiful today, dotted with ferns and bristle trees. Duck\
  \ pairs and grey cranes flying low to the river. The blue skies are far above my\
  \ head. Little ones and their mothers toddle by, one little one's shadow played\
  \ at my feet as a tiny hand swiped towards my short hair in the back but missed\
  \ my stillness as I watched the shadow dance away and giggle to his mother. Perhaps\
  \ he was attracted to the identity or conversation to be had if only there were\
  \ a blossoming r\xF6slein to sing along with. To the left is the school, with its\
  \ bright green copper tee top poking through the brush and trees and the wind keeps\
  \ rustling. \n\tThe rush of the small rapids to the north are in the distance and\
  \ the crunch of wandering feet keeps my ears alert to the footpaths, murmurs of\
  \ Spanish walk by again. Behind me is the vegan bakery with its trendy bright orange\
  \ plastic banners and sears, good bobcake (minus the particularly nutty bits) and\
  \ soy lattes abound. I\u2019ve stopped ordering \u201Cchai\u201D since India. It\u2019\
  s not the same though I have my little stolen tin cup at home that I insisted to\
  \ share with Garold. I spent twenty minutes after our sitar class today in the mezzanine\
  \ room that sits directly above the sitar class to listen in on the advanced section\
  \ and quickly learned it was the batch that made the class, not the standards. I\
  \ am learning how to embody musical knowledge in the way that I can people and social\
  \ structures and mechanisms of manipulation or information collection or conformity\
  \ or teaching or whichever you suppose are more accurate. It\u2019s almost time\
  \ now to pack on from my bench."
