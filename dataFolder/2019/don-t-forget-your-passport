Text: "It was about 8 o\u2019 clock when the sound of the door opening woke me up\
  \ from my sleep. The ticket controller was inside my compartment and asked me to\
  \ show him my ticket. I showed him the ticket that indicated that I travelled from\
  \ Sibiu to Bucharest. It was ok and soon he left. I remained in the compartment\
  \ and felt good and tranquil because it was empty and could continue my sleep while\
  \ listening to the rhythmic music of the train. The continued \u201Ctatam-tatam,\
  \ tatam-tatam\u201D made me sleepy again. While staying with my eyes closed and\
  \ relaxed with my legs stretched on the other empty passenger seats I started to\
  \ imagine how me and my two best friends would have fun in Indonesia. I was excited\
  \ to see  Loredana and Mirela again.\nI was about to fall asleep when I heard my\
  \ phone ring.  Lore wrote to me that she was very anxious. It was the first time\
  \ that she managed for us the system of the 90% discounted flight tickets and did\
  \ not know how it would end. Also, she wrote that she saw that the first flight\
  \ we were about to take to Doha is overbooked and this could mean problems for us.\
  \ \nWe knew the risks of flying with discounted staff tickets already. Lore told\
  \ as many stories of the times in which she remained outside the plane because passengers\
  \ had priority. \nTrying not to think to much about this, I decided to read more\
  \ about Indonesia. I wanted to know more about the things I should take in consideration\
  \ in order to have a peaceful and fun experience. While I was reading I found a\
  \ phrase that emphasizes on the condition of presenting a valid passport at the\
  \ airport. A valid passport... I said to myself \u201CMy passport is valid. I even\
  \ have a nice photo on it.\u201D I remembered the place where I keep it...  After\
  \ that, for a moment I stopped breathing. I remembered that I didn\u2019t wrote\
  \ on my list to take the passport with me. Did I take it?\nI started looking for\
  \ my passport. I knew I didn\u2019t take it because I didn\u2019t remember putting\
  \ it in. Just to be sure I looked and overlooked. It wasn\u2019t with me! \u201C\
  But how could I forget about the passport? Oh! This can not be possible! What can\
  \ I do? It is too late to return home now.  It is 10 a.m. and the flight is about\
  \ 2 pm.\n   ....\nTwo days later we were on a flight to Abu Dhabi. Just 2 minutes\
  \ before the airplane took off we made the booking for the hotel using our phones.\
  \ It seemed that we were  about to go on an adventure after all! And what an adventure!\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find in an Arabic territory so much freedom, fun, spirituality\
  \ and contradictions. \nWe spent almost one full day dressed with black \u201Cabayas\u201D\
  \ while wondering inside the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. Free for visiting, accessible\
  \ for everyone but with two conditions: wearing the abayas for the women and walking\
  \ barefoot inside. I must say I am still amazed about how clean it was everything\
  \ and how soft the Persian carpets were.\nWe were walking on the long Corniche at\
  \ 11 p.m. while admiring the grand sea with the beach on its right side and the\
  \ high-well-lighted sky scrapes on its left. \nWe were tree girls who wanted to\
  \ celebrate so we went to search for a Bar where we could buy beers. Did you know\
  \ that in Arabia the alcohol is forbidden? There are only a few places where it\
  \ can be purchased and at higher costs.\nWe were about to get a cold after discovering\
  \ that even if outside the temperature are high, you must have a sweater on you\
  \ when you\u2019re inside the great Marina Mall with strong air conditioning. \n\
  The best part was the fun part. On Yas Island, our adrenaline reached high levels\
  \ inside the Waterworld and Ferrari World of Adventures.  The most exciting thing\
  \ I\u2019ve ever done was to try to stay chill while being on the Formula Rossa\
  \ roller coaster that reaches the speed of 150 mph."
