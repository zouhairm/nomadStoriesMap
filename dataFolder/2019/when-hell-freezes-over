Text: "Keep that up and you will end up in hell \u2013 \u201CHow did a childhood threat\
  \ come to life?\u201D\n\n\u201CEver heard of La Rinconada?\u201D\nI'm sure it is\
  \ the capital of hell. After 14 months in Latin America it is the 1 place I talk\
  \ about most. Despite being nestled at the base of La Bella Durmiente (The sleeping\
  \ beauty) Glacier in Peru, it will not be the glacial beauty that captures your\
  \ interest here.  \n\nI simply visited La Rinconada to say I had cycled to the highest\
  \ city in the world located at 5100m ASL. I arrived here unprepared, I had no idea\
  \ what to expect. It was like 50,000 people were living in hell with no way of escaping.\
  \  \n\n\u201CHospitality\u201D\nThe great thing with cycling Latin America, there\
  \ is no work in getting to meet the locals. Everyone is intrigued by  your adventure\
  \ and are more than happy to share who they are. The bicycle was the key that opened\
  \ the door to so many conversations and invitations into their personal lives and\
  \ homes. Poncho was one of these people. Soon after meeting he offered me a beer\
  \ and in exchange I gave him a packet of fresh tortillas. As boring as a packet\
  \ of tortillas may be, his reaction and the look on his face was priceless. His\
  \ generosity continued to the dinner table but would not eat with me. It wasn\u2019\
  t till later that I realised I was eating the only meal in the house that night.\n\
  \nHygiene in La Rinconada is pretty much none existent yet while eating dinner the\
  \ idea of food poisoning hadn\u2019t crossed my mind until the dog was given my\
  \ plate to clean. I instantly think:\n \u201CI hope the dog didn\u2019t do the dishes\
  \ last night\u201D. \n\n\u201CGold\u201D\nLa Rinconada is built around gold mining.\
  \ When gold prices increased 235% in the early part of the 21st Century, the population\
  \ of La Rinconada increased by over 30,000, yet the infrastructure failed to improve\
  \ for the population boom. There is no garbage collection and the first sign of\
  \ this was as you neared the city, both sides of the road for several kilometres\
  \ was piled high with a mountain of waste. \n\nThe stench that resonates from the\
  \ piles of garbage is only being controlled by the freezing conditions. The average\
  \ yearly temperature is 1.2c.  They live every day in a place with limited power\
  \ supply, no running water and no sewage. There is minimal police service and the\
  \ municipal authority pretends La Rinconada does not exist. Very few streets are\
  \ paved, the majority of roads and paths suffer from the constant flow of glacial\
  \ melt that runs down through the city. \n\n\n\u201CThe mine\u201D\nYou can learn\
  \ a lot from a discussion over a bottle of cheap alcohol.\nMine workers here do\
  \ not receive a wage. On the last day of each month they are allowed to take as\
  \ much ore as they can carry. There is no guarantee of gold. Several years earlier\
  \ the Peruvian government stepped in to insist that the workers be paid a wage.\
  \ The dream of finding that life changing nugget was that powerful the miners insisted\
  \ on maintaining the current arrangement. \n\nThe main mine is located beneath La\
  \ Bella Durmiente Glacier. The majority of the male population work in the mines\
  \ and the women are banned  from entering as they are considered bad luck. The women\
  \ scaveng for gold through the waste spalls outside the mine. Spiritual superstition\
  \ plays a large part in their lives. Before entering the mine, they give an offering\
  \ to the devil in exchange for safety.\n\n\u201CSlum / Ghetto Tourism\u201D \nSlum\
  \ tourism sparks considerable debate around an uncomfortable moral dilemma as  described\
  \ in an article by Christine Blau.  https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/photography/history-controversy-debate-slum-tourism/)\n\
  \nAt the time of writing this, there is no organised tourism to La Rinconada. Whether\
  \ slum tourism is morally correct or not is your decision. While the number of visitors\
  \ to La Rinconada are low, the locals are still welcoming to those that arrive here.\
  \  \n\nVisiting La Rinconada is not for the faint hearted. After a trip here you\
  \ will have trouble conveying what it is like to have been to this frozen hell."
