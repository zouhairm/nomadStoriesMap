  \ Yaseen,\u201D Yaseen mouthed as he wormed his blunt pencil over his damp notebook.\
  \ I had asked him and three others of grade 5 to write in English, \u201CHomework\
  \ is ten sentences about yourself. You will read it aloud next c--\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Ma\u2019am,\u201D Yaseen interjected hesitantly, \u201CPanchze sentence? Ten is\
  \ much!\u201D \n\n\u201CYou have four days till the next class. Write five, umm\
  \ \u2018panchze\u2019 sentences over two days, and the remaining on the others.\u201D\
  \ He looked at me morosely. Not sure what to make of it, I went on to elaborate\
  \ on their homework. \n\nI was teaching for the first time, in a quaint Kashmiri\
  \ village - Breswana, no less. 2135 kilometres far from home - Bombay, it was the\
  \ raw, unadulterated beauty that Nature intended. Preserved from civilization, the\
  \ road to Breswana wasn\u2019t the road less travelled, it was the road never built.\
  \ And yet, the destination held much allure to me. \n\nMy story in a nutshell -\
  \ a girl\u2019s in continuous search of some unfathomable paradise. One can say\
  \ that I didn\u2019t understand the world around me, and in turn, my world - colleagues,\
  \ friends and family, didn\u2019t understand me. To be honest, I didn\u2019t understand\
  \ me. I tried very hard to fit in and be understood but was happy doing none of\
  \ it. My tribulations went from south to southernmost, and one day I decided this\
  \ was it. No more facades. In needs out. \n\nI quit everything - the city, my job,\
  \ the friends and family and decided to find myself a sanctuary. Only much later\
  \ I realized that I needed to journey within and I actually seeked myself. Apart\
  \ from the journeys I wished to make, I also wanted to create some hard-core impact.\
  \ Teaching children like Yaseen, was it. \n\nAfter a 2-hour plane ride, 10-hour\
  \ drive, my first ever 3-hour pony ride and a \xBD hour trek, I was finally in his\
  \ village. \n\nYaseen was the kind of charming student that any teacher instantly\
  \ expected to be extraordinary. He was my most brilliant yet my most frustrating\
  \ student. He arrived late to school, unkempt, with incomplete homework. But during\
  \ class, he grasped what was taught at the speed of light. As time passed, Yaseen,\
  \ with all his flaws received my undivided attention and a tenderness that I didn\u2019\
  t know I was capable of. It occurred to me that the only other time that a woman\
  \ can know what maternal love, is when she is a teacher to a class of 4 kids. \n\
  \nOne evening, as I trekked across the rocky terrain towards the Volunteer Teacher\
  \ Shrine created as a thank you by the kids of Breswana, I heard an unintelligible\
  \ roar in Kashmiri from a house nearby. Yaseen ran out of it screaming back, \u201C\
  No I no help! I have homework!\u201D\n\nTime had stretched for me in Breswana. This\
  \ may have occurred only a month since I arrived and yet I was extremely protective\
  \ of Yaseen. I rushed forwards with a feline instinct ready to fight whoever was\
  \ threatening my baby, expecting the devil incarnate. Instead, I saw a frail lady,\
  \ looking not so menacing. \n\nLife had taken a toll on her. She was directing Yaseen\
  \ to come towards her with her scrawny hands. Her hair was jet black, her tanned\
  \ skin kissed her bones, her deep blue eyes held stories untold. Just like my little\
  \ boy. It hit me - this screaming lady was his mother. And me, nothing but a temporary\
  \ volunteer teacher. \n\nI instantly started retracting, but she saw me and recognized\
  \ who I was. \u201CVarsha ma\u2019am,\u201D she called out to me. I walked towards\
  \ them and looked at him. Yaseen seemed torn, his blue eyes pierced with tears.\
  \ She glanced at our baby and spoke with guilt as she turned towards me, \u201C\
  I need his help with harvesting, cooking and milking the cow. He\u2019s the eldest.\
  \ His father is no more, and we have mouths to feed.\u201D \n\nI understood at that\
  \ moment: his unsharpened pencils, his soiled white shirts, his unfinished homework\
  \ and the urgent dash to school across mountains every day wasn't out of laziness\
  \ or boredom. \n\nThis brilliant 10-year-old boy was tired."
