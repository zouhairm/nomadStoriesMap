Text: "Nearly Perfect in Perth\n\n \nAustralia holds a certain sway over travelers\
  \ world-wide. With its wide array of cute, furry mammals and over 12,000 kilometers\
  \ of coastline it is easy to see why.\n\nThe Land Down Under is \u201Cfirst world\u201D\
  \ in every way and several Australian cities are prominent. Sydney is the country\u2019\
  s most glamorous city, with its Opera House perched above the Harbor. To the south,\
  \ the city of Melbourne hosts a professional tennis grand-slam event, the Australian\
  \ Open. And north of Sydney, Brisbane is also globally well-regarded.\n\nThose three\
  \ cities, totaling over 10 million people, are all found on Australia\u2019s east\
  \ coast. As is the national capital of Canberra. The iconic Great Barrier Reef lies\
  \ to the northeast and the island of Tasmania to the southeast.\n\nYet, there is\
  \ a lone metropolis sitting like a forgotten pearl on the oft-forgotten western\
  \ side. It is Perth, the capital of the state of Western Australia. \n\nPerth is\
  \ far-removed from other cities of a million people or more. Its closest sizable\
  \ neighbor being Adelaide over 2,200 km away. \n\nThat span would be like driving\
  \ from London to the country of Belarus in eastern Europe. Or from New York City\
  \ to Key West, Florida\n\nPerth is closer to Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia than\
  \ it is to its own national capital. Yet, isolation is not desolation. Perth has\
  \ the skyline of a major world city and the posh amenities of a top tourist attraction.\n\
  \nMinus the flood of tourists\n\nCafes and restaurants with outdoor seating are\
  \ ubiquitous. Frasers, a culinary hot spot for the well-heeled is prominent.\n\n\
  Nature is ever-present alongside the cosmopolitan glitz of Perth. The city overlooks\
  \ the Swan River and its namesake Black Swans. Dolphins playfully carouse in the\
  \ river alongside the stoicism of the swans. \n\nKing\u2019s Park and Botanical\
  \ Garden, is larger than Central Park in NYC. Its massive footprint sits enticingly\
  \ beside the most modern of skyscrapers. King's Park provides a soothing and colorful\
  \ respite from the tempo of city life. \n\nThe Perth metro area stretches like a\
  \ thin, coastal ribbon to the north and south. People wanting to mingle with kangaroos,\
  \ wallabies and koalas can do so at Caversham Wildlife Park. The staff even provide\
  \ photo opportunities with the iconic trio.\n\nPerth averages 8 hours of glorious\
  \ sunshine a day. Cooling sea breezes coupled with low humidity make Perth\u2019\
  s summer temperatures feel pleasant. \n\nMany options off of the beach offer perfect\
  \ ways to absorb the climate Perth enjoys. The southern hemispheres longest wooden\
  \ jetty, over 1.8 km long, awaits in nearby Busselton. Hiking to Ngangaguringguring\
  \ Hill is another outdoorsy opportunity. And if you mispronounce it, few will ever\
  \ know.\n\nA short ferry ride off the coast is Rottnest Island. Rottnest is the\
  \ home to the adorable Quokka (Qwah-kuh), a small marsupial known as the \u201C\
  happiest animal in the world.\u201D Quokkas move about like very small, chubby kangaroos\
  \ and have no predators on the island. They have grown accustomed to tourists and\
  \ their naturally smiling visage makes them all the more endearing. \n\nA man of\
  \ retirement age was lying on the ground beside a Quokka, who joined him for a selfie\
  \ which is a big lure to the island.\n\nWorld-class beaches lie south of Perth alongside\
  \ vineyards in an area known as Margaret River. One of the world\u2019s major kite-surfing\
  \ capitals, a town called Lancelin, is an hours\u2019 drive north of downtown. Four-wheel-drive\
  \ enthusiasts can power up massive white sand dunes standing nearby.\n\nIncredible\
  \ vistas and enviable weather aren't all Perth has going for it. The city boasts\
  \ the most self-made millionaires anywhere in the world due, in part, to the strong\
  \ mining industry in the state. \n\nEach year tourists descend upon the sites along\
  \ Australia\u2019s eastern coast. All while the citizens of Perth wisely revel in\
  \ an overlooked paradise.\n\nAnother reason why the Quokkas are smiling."
