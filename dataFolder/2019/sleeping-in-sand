Text: "Halfway through our 10 pm flight to Santorini, we realize that we forgot to\
  \ book accommodation for our first night there.\n\n\"Let's see if the hostel is\
  \ still open when we get there and we can figure everything out then,\" says Benny\
  \ coolly.  Out of the three of us, she's the one born with a knack for adventure\
  \ - the one who bleached her hair on a whim, solo-traveled through Eastern Europe\
  \ for three months, and goes through life with an intimidating fearlessness. Judy,\
  \ the chronic micro-manager, is biting her nails while looking frantically through\
  \ her travel documents.  I am half asleep, too tired to care.\n\nWhen we land, it\
  \ is midnight and I'm awake enough to have caught some of Judy's contagious anxiety.\
  \  We stand outside the airport for half an hour waiting for a taxi to Perissa,\
  \ famous for its black sand beach.  When we finally find a taxi, the driver names\
  \ an exorbitant price, which we accept with defeated smiles.  The ride is long and\
  \ terrifying.  The driver leans back in his seat, smoking a cigarette, one hand\
  \ on the wheel, the other hand holding his mobile phone. Everyone seems to wear\
  \ singlets and rush about on motor-bikes.  The landscape is arid and hilly - in\
  \ the darkness we can just make out the serrated edge of a towering mountain range.\
  \  I am suddenly overwhelmed by the realization that we are in a strange new country.\
  \ My mind whirls with questions: what if I don't like it here? What if we can't\
  \ find anywhere to stay? What if we have to sleep on the street?\n\nWhen we get\
  \ to Perissa, we leave our luggage in the bag-room of the hostel, which is unexpectedly\
  \ open.  But the reception is closed and a sign on the door states that check-in\
  \ time is 11 am in the morning.  We stand on the front porch considering our options\
  \ for a while. I am on the verge of panic. \"Let's sit on the porch until daytime,\"\
  \ I suggest.  \u201CLet's go and sleep on the beach,\u201D says Benny.  \n\n\"No,\
  \ we're not doing that,\" I say, nervously shifting my weight between my feet. \
  \ Judy has now reached a stage of delirious tiredness where her inhibitions are\
  \ down and she is too exhausted to resist an adventure.  Benny starts walking away\
  \ from the lighted porch, towards the labyrinth of dark streets, without a map and\
  \ only a vague sense of where the beach is based on some signs along the road. \
  \ Judy follows.  I follow, my heartbeat picking up pace.  It is now 1 am in the\
  \ morning.  We wander past bars where pop music is still blaring from the speakers,\
  \ and women in crop tops gyrate next to men with slicked-back hair; and (oddly enough)\
  \ steaming corncobs are being sold from little wooden kiosks.  Our feet sink into\
  \ sand as the tarmac ends, and in front of us we see a mass of blackness, blacker\
  \ than the sky, in perpetual motion.  The line of the tide, where it ebbs and flows,\
  \ is almost imperceptible in the darkness, so that I'm seized by the fear that the\
  \ tide will creep in and we will have no idea until we are sucked under by the waves.\
  \ I tuck my thin jacket around me. It's chilly here, with a crisp wind blowing in\
  \ from off the sea.  \n\nWe stretch ourselves out on the sand and stare at the sky,\
  \ our teeth chattering together as the temperature drops. We change positions, lying\
  \ half-buried in the black sand, still warm from the heat of the day.  At last we\
  \ lie like sardines, pressed up against each other for warmth.  While Benny and\
  \ Judy spot shooting stars, I fall asleep at last, under a sky full of silver, listening\
  \ to the deep-throated, timeless sound of waves. When I open my eyes, the sky is\
  \ brightening, and I am still alive.\n  \nThe sunrise that morning is unlike anything\
  \ I have ever seen - a gradient of blue slowly travelling upwards from the horizon\
  \ while the black falls away like a curtain.  I think that is how I learn the kind\
  \ of courage it takes to have an adventure - gradually, like a sunrise on Santorini."
