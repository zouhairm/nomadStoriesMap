Text: "A leap in to the unknown.! I didn't expect to find .. a local 'spiritual' connection.\n\
  \nAs I landed at New Delhi airport I remember feeling pleasantly surprised at the\
  \ standard of the airport. Friendly.\n\nBeing me I decided to try out the the citys\
  \ new underground metro system to get me to my hotel. I worked my way down to the\
  \ gates and managed to shuffle my way through the rupees I had already exchanged\
  \ prior to leaving at my local exchange in London.\nThe man behind the desk was\
  \ straight forward and gave me my change and token!\n\nAs I entered through the\
  \ gates I felt as if I were in a first world country. \nOn to the platform and after\
  \ speaking with a very friendly man from South delhi, I was sitting next to him\
  \ talking about life. \n\nI always keep my wit's about me whilst traveling, especially\
  \ in anew country. Thus far I was feeling pretty relaxed. He gave me his buisness\
  \ car and said please don't hesitate to get in touch should you need anything or\
  \ any kind of help. \nA very kind gesture I thought, as he waved me off and pointed\
  \ towards the taxi stand.\n\nThe air-conditioning and energy on the metro was calming.\
  \ Outside was hectic!\n\nAs I exited the platform, I walked over a long bridge towards\
  \ the taxi stand. There are many homeless people and many others with ailments,\
  \ amongst the serious hustle. \nI have travelled over 27 countries and been to Bangkok\
  \ 3 times, New Delhi made Bangkok kosan road feel like a walk in a peaceful park\
  \ and  I felt like I had never left my home town.. it was so busy.\n\nIt took me\
  \ about 4 or 5 minutes to get a rickshaw because I could clearly tell the guys were\
  \ trying there best to rip me off. I have it a minute or two before the in your\
  \ face guys leave and then approached a man sitting in his cabin. To the hotel it\
  \ was about 3 minutes. I paid 200 rupees equivalent to \xA32. The other men had\
  \ said 700-500 rupees. It turns out I should have paid 20 rupees. Learning fast.\n\
  \nI had two days in New Delhi before heading out to Rishikesh my destination of\
  \ choice. I have other stories about new Delhi .. interesting ones about being missold\
  \ tickets to Rishikesh, directed to cashmere and having the police treat me like\
  \ royalty and sorting the situation. I will save them for a longer write up.\n\n\
  The bus to Rishikesh was pure freedom. I felt my heart smile and my body feel light.\
  \ I was in a perminant state of pressence and remember watching the landscape change\
  \ as if it were a nature program.\n\nI arrived in Tapovan, Rishikesh at about 5:30\
  \ in the morning. I had to take a rickshaw and a taxi up to the guest house as my\
  \ bus didn't drive all the way in to Rishikesh. I was prepared for anything, it's\
  \ all part of the adventure and I met some great people along the way. Also some\
  \ funny stories and conversations that just made me happy.\n\nBy the time I had\
  \ located the guest house and lay my bag in what seemed to be the reception, I took\
  \ a walk around the property. It was beautiful. The sun was just rising over the\
  \ hill and I could hear the river Ganga somewhere close by.\n\nMy lungs seemed bigger\
  \ already and my body light. I felt safe and home. Very different from New Delhi.\n\
  \nAs I entered the reception room again I sat on a small be changed against the\
  \ wall. I was exhausted. I thought it was best to sit or lay down here until a staff\
  \ member appeared.\nJust then the door opened a few inches and then shut. I was\
  \ tired but it did happen. It happened again and in came this little puppy.\n\n\
  He came over to me and sat behind my foot, looked up to me as I looked down to him.\
  \ We had a moment. \n\nI travelled around India for 2.5 years with him. Now he is\
  \ sleeping on my sofa in Northampton \U0001F64F\U0001F3FD"
