Text: "Well the story starts like this, i was young and 23 and as a Mexican is normal\
  \ to go to study one year of English in another country but I couldn\u2019t go back\
  \ in time becouse the school, so imagine going to France in a full English program\
  \ with the French accent attained to the words they were telling you in English.\
  \ \nOne time a professor of economics wast telling me or asking me, - do you have\
  \ any idea, but it sound like \u201Cdo you have any ID\u201D seriously, no joke\
  \ and I was like, ok I\u2019m Mexican this is a normal question they ask to every\
  \ Mexican in USA, don\u2019t panic, and I answer, of course I have a French student\
  \ Visa, and then everyone laugh then I realized what he said becouse by the way\
  \ the class was full of French people in a English program class, so they understood\
  \ what he was askin becouse they ara used to the accent, but well what can I do.\
  \ \nThen other story of the intership, as a student that earns money in Mexican\
  \ peso imagine doing grocery wasting money in Euro, the cheapest alcohol was wine\
  \ then everyone understood the importance of a bottle opener, we struggled to get\
  \ drunk becouse no one will spend their money on that little super important thing,\
  \ and everyone has to go to the nightclub drunk and with 12 euros, 7 for the little\
  \ drink in the club and the rest for the kebab outside the club, and ad the long\
  \ walk we have to do to get to the club becouse that cheap town don\u2019t have\
  \ public transportation past 10 pm. \nAnother funny story was the friends you make\
  \ but this is more philosophical, you have your friends that you know your entire\
  \ life, isn\u2019t? Well, how is it possible that the friends you made in that 5\
  \ months internship plan are your closest friend of life? I can talk with them about\
  \ everything, and I love them, but we\u2019ll this particular story was the small\
  \ group of 4 Mexicans 2 thailandese and 1 American traveling and talking in English,\
  \ I can not imagine how much fun was for the American to hear us talk in english,\
  \ then one of the thalandese hated one of the Mexican and we constantly hear them\
  \ talk in Thai and heard the word \u201Cplopus\u201D, and we were like -must be\
  \ a color or something, but no at the end of the Erasmus the little Thai girl confessed\
  \ when she was drunk as hell that \u201Cplopus\u201D actually means \u201Cshit face\u201D\
  , and every time they said that word was referred to the Mexican she hate, I had\
  \ a stomachache of laugh that night. \n\nOther thing that I realize is that thanks\
  \ to the friends I made those five months is that I have a home in every part of\
  \ the world, but I can\u2019t afford to go, and being kind to everyone let you to\
  \ have that connection with every one, is not to brag or something but I was the\
  \ Mexican, one of the 50 mexican in the school, that made more friends in the entire\
  \ school, also it helped that my program was little different so I was the only\
  \ foreigner in the class. \n\nThe thing that meant to me was when in Christmas,\
  \ one teacher thought I was found to be all by my self and she invited me to her\
  \ house to have dinner, of course I was pouring tears like a shower in summer when\
  \ she said that, and I have to refuse becouse I was actually going to Rome with\
  \ my friends to spend the Christmas Eve in the Vatican, and that make her so happy,\
  \ it was my French teacher and I bought to her one \u201CRosario\u201D the ones\
  \ Catholics use to pray. \n\nSo I\u2019m 27 and I can tell you that was the time\
  \ of my life, I was full I was happy, it was before adulting and have responsibilities,\
  \ and I miss my friend most of the time but i still talk to them by DM. \n\nThanks\
  \ for reading"
