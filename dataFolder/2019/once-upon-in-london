Text: "It was my fifteen\u2019s birthday and my family asked me what dream I wanted\
  \ to come true for my birthday. London. It was the only and the first thing I could\
  \ think about it. So there I went, with my mom and dad to the most unforgettable\
  \ trip of my life. \nBut you\u2019re probably thinking... Why London?!\nLondon is\
  \ a great city of old and modern art, a lot of world history and one of the center\
  \ of the world city because the is were the Greenwich Mean Time passes. I\u2019\
  m an art and history lover so London was the perfect combination for me.\nBut since\
  \ I only knew it by pictures and the internet, my image of London wasn\u2019t like\
  \ the real London. I was not expecting what I was going to live in the seven days\
  \ that I was going to spend there...\nWe took a flight from S\xE3o Paulo, in Brazil,\
  \ to the airport of Heathrow. I love airports and to take connexion flights cause\
  \ I think that we can get to know more things and places in this way. \nOur time\
  \ in London was not big to get to know all the places I wanted but we were gonna\
  \ try our best to do the most things possible. \nWhen we got there it was nothing\
  \ like I was expecting. It became a true reality, not being a dream anymore. I was\
  \ totally enchanted with the city architecture and how the people behaved. I didnt\
  \ know how diferent London could be from Brazil and it was amazing.\nSo in the firts\
  \ day, we decided to go to the Tate Modern Gallery of art. What an amazing place\
  \ to visit if you love art. Is beautiful and in front of the Millennium bridge.\
  \ They also always have art expositions besides the ones that are in the Gallery.\
  \ It\u2019s contemporary, different, new, surprising and a great experience. \n\
  We also went to the National Gallery wich is the complete opposite from the Tate\
  \ Modern. The National Gallery have the antiques, the classical art and renaissance's\
  \ art. If I had time I would\u2019ve stay there the whole day just looking at the\
  \ paintings and appreciating every details. \nThose two art galleries repesent something\
  \ about London that I didn\u2019t know, London is a city that is in the same time\
  \ is very futuristic, modern and technological and also is antique, classical, old\
  \ times. Is such a beautiful landscape to appreciate. \nHow did I figured that?\
  \ Well, we went to the famous London Eye, one of the places I most liked. It is\
  \ unmissable to go on this ride and see London from the top, with another eyes.\
  \ You can see how London is big and has a contrasting arquitecture. \nOf course\
  \ we went to the Big Ben!! But you can\u2019t easily get inside of it, so we could\
  \ wait. It is something that I can use as an excuse to come back to London some\
  \ day!\nAnother thing that got me surprise there was the food. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ the english people liked so much fish and fries (wich I loved too). I didn\u2019\
  t realy liked the food there because is it very spicy and I\u2019m not a fan of\
  \ spicy food. But It was awesome to go to some pubs, it is a very nice place to\
  \ go if you go to London, there are a lot of them in the city. \nAbout the people...\
  \ since I\u2019m brasilian and we are a very warm people, I could see that the english\
  \ people have a very different culture then us. They\u2019re more close and focous\
  \ on their day time activities. But I thought they would be crass people and they\
  \ are not! \nI was completely enchanted with their accent! I was only used to the\
  \ american english so it was very knew for me! \nAt last, what I have to say about\
  \ this experience is that is was an amazing adventure and something I\u2019ll never\
  \ forget. After that, I discovered my passion with traveling and meeting new people,\
  \ culture, languages and places. This is what I want to do for life: Travel the\
  \ world!"
