Text: "It is Sunday morning in Istanbul. The heavy clouds feel as if they\u2019re\
  \ pressing the heat back into the dusty earth. I leave the tourists and the postcard\
  \ mosques behind me as I walk down into the pane-less, concrete cave that is Tarlaba\u015F\
  \u0131. The market that pulls the neighbourhood together for a morning has eased\
  \ into its rhythm. My bare legs throw confusion onto the faces of passers-by. Each\
  \ set of eyes tries to make sense of this yabanc\u0131 so far from where she belongs.\
  \ Realising my mistake, I buy a long skirt at the first vendor I see and pull the\
  \ fabric over my milky flesh. I walk between tables of olives and fresh produce.\
  \ Running shoes hang above stalls like dice from rear-view mirrors. Bags of nuts\
  \ and tiny scales take their place next to bathroom appliances and bottles of pills.\
  \ There are clothes and books and forgotten things, and each vendor greets me with\
  \ new vigour. Shawls and scarves are held up for me to examine and pieces of halva\
  \ are encouraged into my mouth. The rain bounces off the plastic tarp that makes\
  \ a tunnel out of the winding streets. Soon the drumming is so loud that words are\
  \ abandoned and hand gestures take their place. I practice my Turkish now that I\
  \ have no one to hear me. I make sure to exaggerate the movement of my mouth and\
  \ I shrug my shoulders in apology when no one understands, pointing upwards to blame\
  \ the sky. The tarp gorges under the weight of the rainwater. With a burst of heavy\
  \ downpour, a tie comes loose. Everyone scurries for cover as a large patch of sky\
  \ is exposed.\nI move towards a sheltered doorway. Two men are already huddled in\
  \ the space and they move aside for me. One of them offers me a cigarette and we\
  \ smoke silently as we watch the rain. Someone walks past and steps in a puddle\
  \ that soaks their shoe. They curse profusely. I watch a smile sneak onto the face\
  \ of the man to my left. I turn to him and put out my hand.\n\u2018I\u2019m Anna.\u2019\
  \n\u2018Moussa.\u2019\nHe shakes my hand firmly and his eyes crease in resistance\
  \ to the smoke he blows out one side of his mouth.\nI turn to the other man. He\
  \ gives a little upward nod and offers his hand.\n\u2018Victor. From Nigeria.\u2019\
  \nI shake his hand and smile back at him.\n\u2018From South Africa,\u2019 I say,\
  \ my hand automatically moving to rest on my chest. \n\u2018Ah! Sister. Welcome!\
  \ And what are you doing so far from home?\u2019\nI tell them about my job making\
  \ breakfast in a hostel nearby. Victor nods before resting his head against the\
  \ door frame with his arms folded. He focuses on the people dripping past while\
  \ Moussa begins to tell his own story. He has been waiting seven years for asylum.\
  \ They promised refuge for him and his family in Australia but his papers keep being\
  \ rejected. They tell him to try again. He waits patiently and submits new forms\
  \ every six months. I am struck by his optimism. His family are still in Syria.\
  \ He sends back the money he makes at markets around the city. He sells personalized\
  \ bracelets. Could he make me one?\n\nWalking away, I play with the colourful beads\
  \ and the money he wouldn\u2019t let me give him feels heavy in my pocket. He engraved\
  \ 'Anna' into a small wooden panel while he told me about his daughters and how\
  \ much they had grown.\nThe rain has stopped and the fading light travels down the\
  \ tall minarets as the call to prayer sounds. I watch the birds float above the\
  \ hazy city, and I think of what a privilege it is to move as freely as they do."
