Text: "A queen size bed with color matched duvet and pillows in a private room, nutritious\
  \ homemade dinners, free range eating from the fridge and flying to other states\
  \ to avoid hurricane Irma on September 2017. All these are free of charge. How is\
  \ it possible? \n\nTravel was the ticket of finding myself. Doing well at school,\
  \ university, and getting a good job fulfilled society\u2019s expectation. What\u2019\
  s next? Marriage? Kids? A house? Not for me. I gave myself three years to discover\
  \ myself and the world. Traveling in South-East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South\
  \ America pushed me out of  my comfort zone. Cheap 12 bed-dorms, 30 hours in bus\
  \ feeling unwell, home sick and Bail Belly from non-hygienic street foods, picking\
  \ strawberries being treated like a slave, worst of all, working in an abattoir.\
  \ Yet, I was lucky to meet Thai mom and sister, Aussie and Kiwi moms and dads, Argentinian\
  \ and Peruvian sisters.    \n\nTime to go to Florida. My sole purpose, to learn\
  \ skydiving. Couch-surfing in New Zealand with skydiving instructors opened my eyes\
  \ to a world I\u2019d never contemplated. Could this be my new career? Their passion\
  \ and enthusiasm for this high-flying pastime was obvious. Every spare moment they\
  \ crammed in extra jumps. These multinationals worked in the southern hemisphere\
  \ for summer; the northern for another. Anticipating my first jump, I felt a mixture\
  \ of excitement and trepidation. Would I be scared? I needn\u2019t have worried,\
  \ as we climbed to 15,000 feet I could hardly wait to leap out of the twin otter.\
  \ Always being envious of feathered friends, I was amazed by flying like a bird\
  \ in the sky. I was hooked! The skydiving world beckoned. \n\nFlorida beckoned too.\
  \ My instructors recommended it. But there was a problem. I barely had enough money\
  \ for a month living after paying for my tuition which at $3000 was expensive for\
  \ a backpacking, couch-surfing traveler. Three years of non-stop traveling had taught\
  \ me to have a faith in myself and others. So far I had always been lucky, meeting\
  \ generous souls willing to lend a hand to a traveler. Feeling optimistic, I searched\
  \ couch-surfing hosts. One host had good reviews and reading through his profile,\
  \ I could barely believe it. He was the skydiving center manager. Eureka!\n\nI sent\
  \ a message and got permission to stay. On arrival, a tall man in his 50\u2019s\
  \ wearing a casual t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops welcomed me with sunny enthusiasm.\
  \ His culinary ability was evident by Thai shrimp cuisine served for my first dinner.\
  \ And I stayed in a private room with queen size bed(not on the couch!) with my\
  \ own bathroom. His generosity still astonishes me. Paying for groceries, letting\
  \ me use his car and extending the normal one week couch-surfing limit and inviting\
  \ me to stay for the duration of my training. In addition, when Hurricane Irma came,\
  \ we took a small plane into the air and flew from state to state ahead of the storm.\
  \ One of the perks of being the skydiving manager.\n\nHearing my story, some are\
  \ suspicious wondering if my new found friend had ulterior motives.  It seemed too\
  \ good to be true. One day I asked why he was so charitable to me, a random stranger.\
  \ He answered \u201CAt your age, I wanted to travel the world like you but I couldn\u2019\
  t. I am impressed by what you are doing alone. I would like to help you.\u201D I\
  \ replied \u201CI don\u2019t know how to express how much I appreciate your generosity.\
  \ Maybe I will never be able to repay you. However, I promise I will pay forward\
  \ to other young backpackers in the future when I can.\u201D \n\nThe world is not\
  \ as scary a place for a solo girl traveler as most think. Rather, I found angels\
  \ sharing their unconditional kindness. Having experienced this kindness, I will\
  \ in turn reach out to others and so this cycle will be perpetuated in a world in\
  \ need of good deeds. If I hadn\u2019t been brave enough to give up my mundane life\
  \ and leap into the world, I would never have gotten to know myself, skydiving or\
  \ had these life changing experiences."
