Text: "\u201CTurn your head very carefully and slowly over your left shoulder.\u201D\
  \nAs he did so, I reached for my handset so that I could record the event. Before\
  \ he had even finished turning, Tim reached for his own handset to do the same.\
  \ His was in his pocket, where he expected it to be; mine was not in my pocket,\
  \ where I had expected it to be. My hands fumbled around for it, not wishing to\
  \ take my eyes off this beautiful creature who stumbled so clumsily towards whatever\
  \ it had its intentions so determinedly set upon. Eventually, I managed to hit the\
  \ red record button on the touchscreen, only to realise that I hadn\u2019t yet set\
  \ the camera to record video instead of taking a photo. The blurry image appeared\
  \ on the screen and the phone stalled for what felt like a lot longer than the milliseconds\
  \ it probably took. As soon as I could, I changed the setting to record video and\
  \ pressed the red button again. Just as I did so, it became apparent why the little\
  \ pacioderm had been so singularly set on its destination; unbelievably, we had\
  \ not previously noticed the rest of its herd, who had apparently been grazing in\
  \ bushes on the other side of the road for the entire time we had been there. They\
  \ had been hidden by the foliage they were consuming, but now we saw them we could\
  \ hear them as well; undergrowth rustled and branches snapped as their ravenous\
  \ raid raged on. We both continued to record without saying a word. I wondered if\
  \ Tim had the same realisation that we must have been so deep in concentration when\
  \ we arrived, so focussed on the job in hand before the family had sojourned and\
  \ then so distracted by our discussion of the potential for him to move his beautiful\
  \ family to paradise, that we had missed the stupendously impressive beauty that\
  \ was progressing just a few yards away. The elephants were so majestic. The evening\
  \ sun reclining slowly towards the horizon behind them blessed the vista with auburn\
  \ and golden hues that seemed to accentuate their presence as if they had been superimposed.\
  \ We could have been hallucinating. The dreamy essence of the moment was broken\
  \ by sudden rushes of human activity. Shouting and scurrying, they tried to surround\
  \ the animals, bearing almost every weapon imaginable other than firearms and causing\
  \ the glorious creatures to panic, knocking over the baby one who had just reached\
  \ them as they turned to flee. One of the humans saw the stricken infant and started\
  \ towards it, a kukri raised in his right hand and a burning torch in his left.\
  \ I instinctively roared and started a sprint in his direction, unarmed and frankly\
  \ terrified but with only the safety of the baby elephant anywhere in my conscious\
  \ consideration. The man with the knife and the flame had his concentration wrenched\
  \ from his purpose by my emphatic approach. As I bore down on him, I tried to gauge\
  \ what his response would be, although in hindsight it seems an almost foolish assessment\
  \ to attempt. In the heat of the moment things happen so fast but, when we look\
  \ back at such adrenaline fuelled seconds, it is remarkable how much processing\
  \ our brains can do in such a short period; giving the impression in memory that\
  \ time had almost stood still just for us to assimilate all of the information.\
  \ How typically egoic of the human to think such a thing. In that long-short time,\
  \ the man\u2019s expression changed from total surprise, to immediate anger, but\
  \ then to a kind of bewildered contrition; the light of compassionate apology soaking\
  \ his face. I had distracted him from the purpose I had perceived him to have for\
  \ just long enough for the baby elephant to rise to its hind legs and front knees.\
  \ The man saw the elephant rising and threw the kukri. My scream of rage intensified\
  \ when I thought that the knife had struck the poor animal. But perspective can\
  \ be deceiving. The man had thrown the weapon down and held his empty hand out as\
  \ if to plead with me. Everything stopped."
