Text: "Roommates. I love them.  I hate them.  But I mostly loved mine well, minus\
  \ two crazy gingers on different occasions.  \n\nOne of my favorite roommates was\
  \ Brutus (name changed), who I lived with in San Diego.  Brutus was a tattoo artist\
  \ with a couple piercings and a mohawk.  We met in high school when he looked like\
  \ the 6th member or O-Town, with his frosted tips and boy next-door look, quite\
  \ the juxtaposition now, right?\n\nOne night, as I was attempting to catch up on\
  \ my necessary beauty sleep, Brutus and his bartender friend, Houston (name changed),\
  \ bellowed over cigarettes underneath my window.  I started popping off and finally\
  \ dragged myself downstairs wrapped in my blue comforter looking like a disheveled\
  \ Virgin Mary.\n\nAfter listening and laughing at those two drunken knuckleheads\
  \ chatter, Mexico became a topic.  I announced I had not been to Mexico since I\
  \ was 15.  With a sparkle and glimmer in his eyes, Brutus asked me if I wanted to\
  \ go to Tijuana so he and Houston could continue drinking. \n\nI said yes.  I would\
  \ drive us.  We jumped in my sweet Sable of Awesomeness and headed down to San Ysidro.\n\
  \nAfter walking across the Border (yes, that one), we caught a cab and headed to\
  \ a bar.  Mind you, I\u2019m in yoga pants, an old softball sweatshirt (are you\
  \ seeing a theme to my inadvertent nights out?) and we pull up to a place with women\
  \ lined up outside, wearing cut out bright, multi-colored dresses that you would\
  \ need a paint scraper to get off.\n\nSeverely annoyed and completely underdressed,\
  \ I start bitching and complaining that I didn\u2019t know we were going to a club\
  \ and blah blah blah.\n\nBrutus and Houston told me to relax and that I would be\
  \ fine.  Don\u2019t ever tell me to relax.  I was a millisecond from karate chopping\
  \ both of them in the Adam\u2019s apple and scissor kicking their faces off and\
  \ catching a cab back to the Border.  Damn my loyalty to my friends! I elected to\
  \ stay.\n\nWe walk through the doors and I see multiple stripper poles on a platformed\
  \ stage.  We are at a strip club that had a bar opened all night.  This made more\
  \ sense and I ordered tequila shots for myself to deal with this filthy Mexican\
  \ strip club in the heart of Tijuana I was in.\n\nForty minutes and 3 tequila shots\
  \ (when in Rome, eh?) later, I ask Brutus why there are no girls on the pole.  He\
  \ informs me nonchalantly that we \u201Care in a whore house.\u201D\n\nI laugh.\
  \  He always likes to mess with.  Case and point, he told a guy I was seeing/dating\
  \ that I would poop in the plants in our apartment; that, one day, he came home\
  \ to me squatting over a houseplant dropping a poo.  This is a complete fabrication,\
  \ I assure you, dear reader.\n\nI ignore him. Another forty minutes later, still\
  \ no girl on a pole.  I ask Brutus again, why no one was on a pole.  He repeated\
  \ his first response and reiterated we were in a \u201CTijuana whore house\u201D\
  \ and told me to look around.  I saw nerdy, white guys who had beautiful voluptuous\
  \ women throwing themselves at these Lambda Lambda Lambda geeks. \n\nHoly shit.\
  \  These drunk motherfuckers dragged me to a Tijuana whore house so they could drink\
  \ all night at 24-hour bar.  Flashes of the scantily cladded women side eyeing me\
  \ as well as the multiple trips to the ladies room reemerged in my consciousness.\
  \  I am sure I caught some tropical strain of hepatitis, chlamydia, HPV and let\u2019\
  s skip the HIV to full-blown AIDS.  Will there be a donkey show that accompanied\
  \ any pole dancing?  I had a panic attack and a plethora of questions.  I went into\
  \ catatonic shock.\n\nAfter the illumination of my current setting, I noticed Houston\
  \ had been gone for a majority of our excursion.  Evidently, he had slipped away\
  \ with a lady of the night, Roxanne, and she was wearing a red dress (ok, I made\
  \ up the name and outfit but come on, figuratively).\n\nHe returned to our table\
  \ briefly but disappeared outside for a \u201Ccigarette.\u201D\n\nTurns out, Houston\
  \ had the brilliant idea to purchase coke from a random on the street (Darwin should\
  \ have stepped in at that point and struck him in the head with a Galapagos turtle).\
  \  Fortunately, Houston was given a small baggy with 25 other tiny baggies wrapped\
  \ in them.  I was grateful the man, who sold him the baggies at the street taco\
  \ stand, wasn\u2019t a police officer because I\u2019m not hard enough to face a\
  \ Tijuana jail or have enough money to pay anyone off.\n\nWe headed back to the\
  \ Border via another cab and crossed it at dawn with 3000 other people.\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t believe where the night had taken me, let alone, I was in a (for the thousandth\
  \ time) in a Tijuana whore house sans a Donkey Show.\n\nI did head to the local\
  \ clinic to get an STD test and AIDS test a couple days later.  Negative, putas!"
