Text: "An inexpensive tour to tequila caves. A group of perky Americans ready to party.\
  \ A young teacher eager to show off her Spanish. This all describes my trip to Mexico\
  \ a few years ago where I should have been excited to visit my father\u2019s birthplace,\
  \ but instead I was looking to taste a variety of tasty tequila. \nAs a language\
  \ teacher, I knew that most of Tequila (the town\u2019s name) would be filled with\
  \ cultural values, but as a naive first-timer in Guadalajara, I wasn\u2019t prepared\
  \ for the valuable lessons I would learn when exploring this small, popular, yet\
  \ quaint town. \nWe started off with our tour guide offering us some tequila (he\
  \ was just as excited to let us have fun as we were), but little did we know that\
  \ we would be experiencing a part of Mexican culture that not many are privy to.\
  \ My father often spoke of the blue agave filled valleys and the insurmountable\
  \ landscapes that seemed to never end; however, driving closer and closer to our\
  \ destination, and listening to our tour guide describe the history behind each\
  \ mountain and valley was intriguing. \nWe ended up in caves, ranches, valleys,\
  \ and even an hacienda turned into a tequila museum, but the tequila was not the\
  \ reason we got drunk with joy\u2014it was the trip itself that forced each of the\
  \ tourists become friends and experts of this small town that had amazing Spanish\
  \ influenced architecture, cobble stoned alleys, and the friendliest and most generous\
  \ residents one would ever meet in such a gimmicky tour. \nI left Tequila not only\
  \ valuing the process of Mexico\u2019s most popular alcoholic beverage (and learned\
  \ to respect the intake), by also cherishing my Mexican heritage and my father\u2019\
  s birthplace."
