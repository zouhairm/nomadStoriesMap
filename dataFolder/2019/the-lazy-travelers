Text: "As soon as our plane landed, our little journey began. Kemer, where my mom\
  \ and I spent all week, is a quiet and sweet place, where it\u2019s pleasant to\
  \ come with family, in order to cool off, slow things down, clear your mind and\
  \ simply enjoy each other's company. \n \nKemer is a compact resort town in two\
  \ hours of a ride from Antalii, where there is ice-cream, souvenir lavas and fruits.\
  \ And what such a beautiful sunset is here! And mountains! \n \nJourney started,\
  \ but It's hard to actually call us travellers more likely lazy tourists. As usual,\
  \ it happens, you wake up in the morning, go to lunch, then to the sea. And that\u2019\
  s You have already felt as time slows down, mind reported to body that you don't\
  \ need to go anywhere and there is nobody to save. There are only ocean noises and\
  \ fresh sea breeze. The only one thing comes, it\u2019s meditative state. It\u2019\
  s a magical state like a stream of consciousness. \n \nA couple of days later, energy\
  \ balance was restored. We were full of juice and strength we were ready to move\
  \ mountains. But instead of to move mountains we climbed the mountain. This is the\
  \ first climbing for us. The way to the top of the mountain was got off my chest\
  \ and become a little closer to distant and so indifferent stars. We woke up early\
  \ in the morning, so that by nooning to get to the point. In the beginning mountain\
  \ the path was pretty smooth. We rather walked chipper, keep the rhythm. But after\
  \ a while, the Sun is overhead, our path has changed your temper and it didn\u2019\
  t even seem so friendly. Rotation angle was getting above. I swallowed and felt\
  \ it burn my lungs, sweat fell down on the forehead, water ended. It seemed as you\
  \ are going to faint. But taking a step back. It's not for us. Maybe I describe\
  \ this like a heroic deed. People have climbed Everest, but it was a really achievement.\
  \ In simply terms it was the same outside of your comfort zone. \n \nThe final push\
  \ and We find ourselves on the road. It\u2019s funny, it is easy to reach by car,\
  \ but it is not for us! I was truly happy that we were going down the complicated\
  \ road. I don\u2019t want to take what I can get. In fact, our point was only an\
  \ observation deck. I don\u2019t know what came over me, more likely overflowing\
  \ with bravery or desire a glass of water, a lot of water. I decided to go up to\
  \ tower. Workers have proved very friendly, and they didn\u2019t throw me out. Moreover,\
  \ they gave me a bottle of water! At the moment, it seemed me unprecedented generosity.\
  \ I was drinking and feeling how hot had letting go, pulse had slowly slowing down,\
  \ mind had become clear. And I finally noticed I was looking at the city and them\
  \ neighbouring from height of the bird's flight. Everything seems so small. High\
  \ makes even the longest street puppet. \n \nWhat does it feel like when you stand\
  \ on the top of the mountain? It\u2019s hard to explain. Someone who already raised\
  \ would understand without any explanation. Someone who never went to mountains,\
  \ nor does it intend and wondered with question \"what's the point of climbing?\
  \ Why waste your time?\" There's no point in even trying to explain them. These\
  \ emotions have to get through. It\u2019s all individual. This all seems so unrealistic\
  \ to a person like me living in town. Despite the fact there were a lot of people\
  \ in Kemer. At that moment I felt as lonely seaman in sailing. If you find yourself\
  \ standing a top a mountain under blue skies overlooking a beautiful view, you\u2019\
  re feeling freedom. It seemed to me, as I let go my soul to float somewhere in the\
  \ ocean. \n \nMountains are they as eternity. Here, they stood thousands of years\
  \ ago and will stand next thousand years, trusting in their sharp tops to sky. I\
  \ won't be, my children won\u2019t be, but the mountains will stand as well unapproachable."
