Text: "The first time I got admitted to a hospital, all thanks to that one successful\
  \ mosquito, lying down, nauseated suffering from dengue, I realized that I haven't\
  \ traveled in the last eight years. There was no specific colorful memory I could\
  \ escape into. So immediately, two days after my release, I booked my tickets even\
  \ though I remember being told almost twenty times that I was meant to stay in bed\
  \ for a week. One can say my frustration cured me early! \nEvery year a big music\
  \ festival is held in Meghalaya. Four stages are set amidst huge valleys and hundreds\
  \ of people turn up. The lineup was had Steve Vai in it and one who knows of him\
  \ knows how exclusive he is. I landed in Guwahati as Meghalaya airport is less used\
  \ and very costly and I took a cab from there to Shillong, the heartland of Meghalaya.\
  \ Thirty minutes into the ride and the rows after rows hills start showing up. The\
  \ October wind just suggests the coming of winter and my dengue ridden soul couldn't\
  \ feel more alive. This is the first time I was traveling alone and I wouldn't lie,\
  \ there was a certain amount of anxiety in my head. But every time my eyes crossed\
  \ those blooming flowers on every tree on the hills, my soul screamed like a little\
  \ girl. The velvety leaves of the tall pine trees on either side of the road took\
  \ me back into some childhood storybook that I can't remember. The sunlight breaking\
  \ in through the gaps of every distant tree glistened up everything around me. \
  \ Soon it started to get colder and I knew I have entered Shillong.\nThe most interesting\
  \ part of Shillong is the houses. They are small wooden houses with lower ceilings,\
  \ even the restaurants and I walked into one of them for some freshly cooked pork\
  \ rice. My mouth waters even as I write about it. It was indeed the best I ever\
  \ had. I was putting up at The Anchorage guest house. What would warm your soul\
  \ are eight cocker spaniels who keep running around the place. They had this European\
  \ decor with a full bloom garden. The fern lining around the huge trees, surrounded\
  \ by some blue hydrangeas, some glowing marigolds and some red flowers I know not\
  \ the name. After much adoration, I realized that it was time for me to gear up\
  \ and take a bus to Wenfield, The Festive Hills. It was the valley where the music\
  \ festival was going to happen. Much to my surprise for the first hour, I was in\
  \ huge traffic within the city, and the destination is almost three hours away from\
  \ where I stayed. In two hours, we were outside the city, passing my grasslands\
  \ and barren hills with construction work going on. It was getting colder and kept\
  \ sipping on some port wine. The sun went down and in the car, I couldn't wait to\
  \ glance at it. In a few minutes, we were engulfed in darkness and I mean pitch\
  \ black darkness. There were no street lights to help you. You can't even see your\
  \ own hand and my heart started to beat faster. The adventure was starting and I\
  \ wanted to scream. \nI reached my venue and there were almost a thousand people,\
  \ waiting to see Steve Vai. I could smell the barbecue at each corner as I entered\
  \ the festival. I was a bit late and it was almost time for Vai to play to come\
  \ on stage. I looked around, people were dancing, some naked at seven degrees, some\
  \ high as a kite and I took out my LSD and put it on my tongue. The setting was\
  \ perfect, lights were right, the vibe was on and I was waiting for Mr. Hofmann\
  \ to take off. As time flew, I found myself surfing on every note of 'Tender Surrender'.\
  \ Every soul was grooving, every eye so joyous and my heart racing at the speed\
  \ of light. The starry sky seemed to have their own orchestra and we all danced.\
  \ That night I lived as I dreamt. I was so alive."
