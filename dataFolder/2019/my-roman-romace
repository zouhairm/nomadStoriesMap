Text: "In the entire 26 years of my life, I did not expect to find myself in a lot\
  \ of situations. After leading a fairly comfortable childhood as the only kid of\
  \ my amazing parents (yay? still debatable) I expected neither to be pushed into\
  \ a career with no say in it (FYI I am a computer engineer by day, dreamer by night.\
  \ Ask any average Indian kid, you will know what I am talking about!), nor losing\
  \ my mother to cancer at 23. I also didn\u2019t expect to completely uproot my life\
  \ after six months of that and move halfway across the world to Frankfurt (7608\
  \ KMs to be precise). Coming to the present day, almost 2 years after moving here,\
  \ I absolutely didn\u2019t expect to find someone special, and take the most wonderful\
  \ trip of my life to Rome with him. All within barely 1.5 months of our first date.\
  \ For the sake of word limit, (I have exhausted 182 words already! Great!) I will\
  \ keep the description of my epic romance brief and focus on Rome. \n\nOne day at\
  \ work I found the best deals everywhere on a trip to Rome (I know you are gonna\
  \ say come on. But seriously! Pinky swear.) Everything aligned. The flights, the\
  \ Airbnb, our work schedules. Everything! Why Rome? Being history/architecture/literature\
  \ addicts it is both of our favorite city on Earth! (Honestly, what else did you\
  \ expect?!) After two weeks of meticulous planning (I am full on OCD and he is German\
  \ ergo self-explanatory), praying for perfect weather and dreaming about it we were\
  \ there!\n\nIt was love at first sight. And fortunately, it was both ways! We fell\
  \ in love with the shining Sun (tourists coming from minus 8 degrees!), the breeze,\
  \ the perfect trees and the smell of history in the air. Rome showered its love\
  \ (heads up a totally true narrative) when I found an abandoned red rose on my bus\
  \ seat from the airport to Airbnb. I still want to believe it was Rome welcoming\
  \ us with open arms, romantic styles. We spent four days of total bliss in our paradise.\
  \ Even though it\u2019s brand new love, we finish each others\u2026  sandwiches?\
  \ Rome took us by storm. We had many of our firsts there. \n\nDay 1: First picnic\
  \ on a bench near the Spanish steps (only coz a lovely policewoman shooed us away\
  \ from our actual picnic on the steps! No food allowed but apparently you can drink\
  \ and smoke there you see.)\n\nEvening 1: The walk home while I shivered from the\
  \ night chill and he held me so tight that I was actually thankful for my total\
  \ disregard of the temperature and choice of a completely wrong outfit. Also our\
  \ first passionate public kiss on a street near the Trevi Fountain. Hereby declared\
  \ as my favorite street on the planet. I swear that the streetlights turned on as\
  \ we kissed! Disney magic maybe?\n\nDay 2: Our first visit to the Vatican for a\
  \ mass at the biggest church in the world. The divine experience managed to wrangle\
  \ a tear even from the eyes of the biggest agnostic I know. Me.\n\nEvening 2: Our\
  \ ultimate realization that the most beautiful church in Rome isn\u2019t one of\
  \ the most elaborate ones. It is the Pantheon instead. So simple yet standing proudly\
  \ in its elegance with no frills. Also as promised by J the best coffee on Earth\
  \ at Tazza D\u2019oro Caf\xE9 200 Meters away from it. \n\nDay 3: Our completely\
  \ ostentatious visit to the incredible Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel. Long story\
  \ short, we aren\u2019t as smart in art or history as we thought. After 3 hours\
  \ of sheer marvel, we accepted defeat with humility.\n\nEvening 3: The wet dream\
  \ of every history nerd. Colosseum. Lessons were learned about our limited knowledge\
  \ at the museum and hence we doled out some extra cash for 45 minutes guided tour\
  \ by an actual archaeologist this time! TOTALLY WORTH IT.\n\nFinal Day: What do\
  \ you do when the flight is at 14:30? You wake up at 6. Then reach the Romano Forum\
  \ 15 minutes before sunrise and spend 2.5 hours wandering the trails of ancient\
  \ Romans. Beholding. Beaming. Beatified. Besotted. Bewildered."
