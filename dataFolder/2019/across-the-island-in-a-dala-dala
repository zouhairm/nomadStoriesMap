Text: "Our bags were ripped from our hands and we piled in one at a time, shuffling\
  \ on our knees yet still hitting our heads on the low hanging roof. My brother and\
  \ I had insisted we wanted to travel like the Zanzibar locals, so we turned down\
  \ the swarm of taxi drivers offering aircon and comfort and high prices, and followed\
  \ our new friends from Dar Es Salaam into the parts of Stone Town frequented by\
  \ locals only. \n\nWe\u2019d met Obakeng and Kibwana in the reception of our hostel\
  \ earlier that morning. Like most hostels, the atmosphere was ripe for friendly\
  \ interactions and the oversharing of information between people who were barely\
  \ acquainted, which is how we came to realise we were both heading across the island\
  \ to the East coastline. \u201CYou can come with us, South Africa\u201D they\u2019\
  d said. They had never met anyone from our country before, so we did in fact represent\
  \ a whole country \u2013 at least to them. \n\nWe\u2019d walked with Obakeng and\
  \ Kibwana to a spot were two roads met. Roads that had been so worn down by frequent\
  \ use they only showed old patches of tar. It was a spot where the local men met;\
  \ to have animated discussions, to share cold beverages sip for sip out of glass\
  \ bottles, to enjoy homemade chapattis and salted peanuts in the company of one\
  \ another, sitting on upside-down crates. And, it was also a spot were dala-dalas,\
  \ the local taxi-meets-truck transport, met to share stories and swop passengers.\
  \ There is no schedule and no ticket system, just the raw exchange of silver coins\
  \ and a small head nod. \n\nNow we were crammed in the back of a dala-dala with\
  \ at least 23 other people, which only comfortably seats 14, like toes in a new\
  \ pair of fancy shoes, hoping our backpacks had followed us. It would have been\
  \ a comical turn of events, at least financially, thinking we were saving our shillings\
  \ only to find we\u2019d paid a small fee to have our things distributed amongst\
  \ the market warren. We caught our reflection in the windows of fellow dala-dalas\
  \ shuffling past, and we were relieved to spot our backpacks nestled amongst the\
  \ bags of Maize meal and sugar, two chairs, a bicycle, a stack of firewood and an\
  \ oversized pumpkin. A man sat on the roof too, keeping watch over the flock of\
  \ belongings (although come to think of it, he could have just as easily been a\
  \ stowaway). Our dala-dala looked like badly-packed luggage, bursting at the seams\
  \ as the thin ropes that zipped across the items on the roof struggled to contain\
  \ the items neatly and securely. The inside of the dala-dala was alive with smells\
  \ and colours and strangers, sweating on each other.\n\nI\u2019d been so focused\
  \ and alert getting to the dala-dala, and had been weighed down by the effort of\
  \ carrying my backpack through the crowded streets in the heat of the day, I soon\
  \ fell asleep hugging my camera bag despite the road bumps. The little girl sitting\
  \ next to me fell asleep on my knee, and moved my dress ever so slightly above my\
  \ knee (to the dismay of the other passengers, I was sure), while her mother protectively\
  \ held a whole tray of eggs just above the little girl\u2019s head. I woke up every\
  \ now and then, when the dala-dala, like an afterthought, stopped abruptly to allow\
  \ a passenger to get off. One man even pulled a live chicken out from under his\
  \ seat before disembarking, taking great delight in my surprise, his laugh like\
  \ a small and troublesome lawnmower. \n\nEven though we had only ridden in the dala-dala\
  \ for 2 hours or so, we learnt each passenger\u2019s individual destinations, which\
  \ rooftop item belonged to whom and whether or not they travelled alone. In that\
  \ short trip we gained more insight into the lives of the locals than holidaymakers\
  \ who spend in excess of two weeks on the island, floating in the resort pools and\
  \ indulging in the hotel buffet, choosing to keep their wifi connection rather than\
  \ making a local connection."
