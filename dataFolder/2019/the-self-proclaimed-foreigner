Text: "\u2018GO! MOVE! BUS NOW!\u2019 \nNo, we were not in a disaster evacuation camp.\
  \ \n\u2018 If we do not look after everyone\u2019s time, there will be no food left\
  \ at the restaurant.\u2019\nI suppose cooperation is key to the collective survival\
  \ in the hustle and bustle Chinese leisure traveling world.\n\u2018We MUST make\
  \ it to Yulong River after lunch, don\u2019t tell anyone that I guided you to Guilin\
  \ China without that visit!\u2019 Words blasted through the tour guide\u2019s microphone,\
  \ feisty Mandarin steaming the chilly mountain air around her. The air of Guilin\
  \ in December was humid but crisp.\nI slid into the backseat of the coach, hoping\
  \ to attract the least attention in a packed local tour. I may have exchanged some\
  \ nods and polite words with the group, revealing my accent filled foreigner style\
  \ mandarin. Choking on these accents, I almost died of self -inflicted embarrassment.\
  \ \nAs we approached the restaurant, a man in the front cleared his throat loud\
  \ then spat into a bin inside the coach walkway while I followed and refrained my\
  \ eyes from drifting there.  \nIn the room, the table with remaining seats was shared\
  \ with a family. A boiling pot was in the middle, getting ready for the local delicacy\
  \ of beer brewed fish. I scanned the table: chopsticks were lined up around by the\
  \ exact number of people there.  \n\u2018Where are the communal chopsticks? It\u2019\
  s unhygienic to share a meal in a pot with everyone\u2019s chopsticks dipped in\
  \ it, it doesn\u2019t matter to the family sharing, but we are not part of them.\u2019\
  \ The family turned to look at the guide for a solution, exchanging a few gazes\
  \ with mine. \n\u2018 Look around you, communal chopsticks are just not practiced\
  \ here. This is not a dish to be missed but you are free to eat elsewhere if you\
  \ prefer.\u2019  I left the restaurant accompanied by the gaze of the elder man\
  \ in the family, unoffended but slightly sorry. I felt a taste of guilt, for how\
  \ my sentiment was expressed.\nBack into our coach, our guide asked how the fish\
  \ was. A man in the back yelled \u2018TERRIBLE, the restaurant didn\u2019t get the\
  \ fish drunk enough.\u2019 The group eased off as the guide \u2018re-educated\u2019\
  \ his mischievous comments. I wished I could pass out on this would-have-been heavily\
  \ drunk fish. \nWe spent the day blindfolded by the hazy windows as we hit he road.\
  \ Ambiguous shapes of mountains and dark greens flashed by, backed with tunes of\
  \ the singing guide. \nMaintaining body temperature while being underdressed on\
  \ the river was exhausting for everyone. We seemed to put the micro-drama at lunch\
  \ behind by the time we arrived at another dining spot for dinner. Of the two tables,\
  \ there was only one seat on each left. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll go with the family\
  \ table.\u2019 My mom said with a slightly disgruntled tone. \nOnce settled, somebody\
  \ requested extra chopsticks for the tables. Within seconds, we were picking up\
  \ food for each others\u2019 bowls, a friendly gesture on the Chinese dining table.\
  \ I looked over my mom\u2019s table, they brought rice wine to share. It was heartfelt\
  \ hospitality reflected in her smile as her table mates offered more wine, food\
  \ and curiosity of her origins. The narrowed feeling in my stomach was a thing in\
  \ the past. \nDinner was over when our guide of heightened sense of time awareness\
  \ herded us out to our last destination of the day. \n\u2018Everyone stop eating!\
  \ BUS NOW!\u2019 \nThe commanding style of tour guiding was strangely effective\
  \ here. We marched with the elder man, shoulders next to each other, he asks \u2018\
  See, we\u2019re not that bad right? Are you having fun?\u2019 My mom replied \u2018\
  Yes of course, I never meant to insult the family at lunch\u2019. The man laughed\
  \ from the bottom of his stomach, puffs of warm air rising above him.\nIt occurred\
  \ to me, I wasn\u2019t foreign to the place because of the language spoken or customs\
  \ followed. I was a foreigner at heart because of the silent witnessing and deliberate\
  \ isolation from reaching out. One could really enjoy Guilin in December huddled\
  \ together lead by  an ever-hustling guide."
