Text: "The wind swept through the hut, bringing with it the scent of coconut and cinnamon.\
  \ The late afternoon sun tip toed across the top of my noise. The ocean hummed peacefully,\
  \ people quietly conversed in the distance, birds chirped. It was as if I had been\
  \ plucked out of my life and placed, neatly into paradise. Yet here I was - head\
  \ down flat on the bed, knees crunched together in agony, sweaty palms struggling\
  \ to wipe the hair off my face. I tried to fight the nausea but it was relentless.\
  \ Like holding a single finger up to stop an all consuming tsunami of pain. Hopeless.\
  \ \n\nI awaited the doctors return, trembling with the terror that comes with all\
  \ anticipatory news. Was I dying? Would I ever return to the gloomy, greys of Melbourne?\
  \ The idea of a cool breeze crawled its way into my thoughts, one icicle at a time.\
  \ The big wooden door opened and a bucket load of steamy, thick air encased my face.\
  \ I was brought out of my daydream instantly. My weary eyes managed to open. The\
  \ doctor stood at the edge of my bed. He\u2019s lips puckered, he\u2019s head tilted\
  \ slightly to the left, he\u2019s expression a mixture of concern and .. was that\
  \ amusement? Look, I knew I wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. I was wearing my stained\
  \ white dress with a rip on the shoulder and I now had a head of hair that looked\
  \ like a literal birds nest, but I had given up at this point. Hell, I had given\
  \ up on caring about my appearance the minute I handed my clothes in to a what I\
  \ thought was a local laundry matt, only to realise the next day that the little\
  \ old lady who took my things was a lier and all my clothes had been sold. It was\
  \ Asia. It was humid and now I was uncontrollably nauseous and at serious risk of\
  \ dying. Or at least, that\u2019s how it felt. \n\nIn broken english, the Thai doctor\
  \ proceeded to explain I had the symptoms of - you guessed it - nausea. Riveting.\
  \ I replied in a hopeless sigh, \u2018What can I do then?\u201D. Black spots started\
  \ appearing in my vision, colours merged into one, the room tipped on its side.\
  \ I heard a buzz of concerned Thai voices circle around me like flies. I clamped\
  \ my eyes shut with a grimace. At that moment, the door banged open again. Although\
  \ this time, there was no noise, no woosh of air. The room fell eerily silent. \
  \ A single voice spoke. It was a western voice and it spoke with force. \u201CShe\
  \ needs baldaram\u201D. Baldaram? Was that a person? Or a type of medicine? I had\
  \ no strength left to open my eyes and look at this strange voice who\u2019s words\
  \ felt like cement. \u201CTake my hand\u201D, it bellowed. I didn\u2019t have a\
  \ chance to think about the consequences of my actions. No thoughts arose about\
  \ how I was putting my life into the hands of a stranger whom I did not know or\
  \ trust. It was as if the desperate part of my soul begging to stay alive escaped\
  \ out of my chest and leapt into my own hand pulling it towards the voice. \u201C\
  Okay\u201D, I answered. And away we went."
