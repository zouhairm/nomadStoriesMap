Text: "My husband and I along with our two girls moved to the gorgeous state of Colorado\
  \ about 2 yrs ago. Since we\u2019ve moved, we have rediscovered the great outdoors\
  \ and our love for nature. And much to our surprise, we have also discovered our\
  \ love for camping. We have now camped all over the western side of the US. We\u2019\
  ve camped in the mountains, by rivers and lakes, and also near the ocean. Camping\
  \ in the west has been almost magical, there is just something so invigorating about\
  \ feeling the brisk fresh air coupled with the smell of a burning crackling campfire.\
  \ At night when you look up and see the brightly lit sky filled with all its twinkling\
  \ stars and realize that there are hundreds that you\u2019ve never even seen before\
  \ well that takes it to a whole new level. Not to mention that it\u2019s a beautiful\
  \ experience to wake up to a new day with a beautiful sunrise and the birds chirping\
  \ as the morning fog rolls off the mountains or the water. And hearing your daughters\
  \ laughing with each other as they move away from their technological devices, the\
  \ stress of school and life and just relaxing, enjoying each other, now that\u2019\
  s priceless. These have been some of our favorite moments and ones that we didn\u2019\
  t expect to experience quite like we have. \n However one thing that we have also\
  \ discovered that is that along with these beautiful priceless moments come other\
  \ not so beautiful times. For example the one night that my husband heard a loud\
  \ shuffling rumble by our campsite. The next morning there were big paw prints proving\
  \ what he heard. The park rangers estimated it to be around a 400 pound bear. Or\
  \ that night when I got up to use the restroom only to see several pairs of eyes\
  \ looking at me as they slowly slinked on by as I shone my flashlight at them. From\
  \ our research and the way they walked it looks like it was 2 mountain lions. After\
  \ that experience I laid awake all night in that tent with my teeth chattering waiting\
  \ for daylight. There was also the time that me and a friend got serious food poisoning\
  \ from a cute little restaurant on the way to our camp by the water. Thankfully\
  \ there were restrooms there. And then that time when after a long beautiful hike\
  \ we came back to our campsite to find our tent destroyed by the wind. We spent\
  \ that night in the truck and it wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable either. \n There\
  \ have been a few other things about camping that weren\u2019t so fun, however the\
  \ good things outweigh the bad by a long shot. Things such as being with family\
  \ and friends and playing games as we laugh all night. Trying to cook breakfast\
  \ in the rain only to dump it all out and find an adorable coffee shop where we\
  \ sit and talk for hours, or leaving the campsite and hiking deeper into nature\
  \ singing loudly at the top of our lungs have been just a few of these wonderful\
  \ unexpected things that we\u2019ve experienced. \n In conclusion camping has been\
  \ a wonderful experience for us. We were a bit skeptical in the beginning and we\
  \ went into this not expecting much. Along the way we have learned a lot, laughed\
  \ a lot and cried a few tears but overall we are so glad that we have gotten out\
  \ of our comfort zone. And in this super busy, crazy, technological world we live\
  \ it, camping has shown us how to relax and enjoy nature and appreciate each other\
  \ more as the people we love and care for. We plan to continue camping together\
  \ as a family and we can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds for us in this\
  \ area."
