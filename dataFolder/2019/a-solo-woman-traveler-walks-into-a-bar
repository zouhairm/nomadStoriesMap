Text: "\u201CAre you all by yourself?\u201D \n\nInquisitive faces - not quite leering,\
  \ but enough to set off cautionary alarm bells - attached to four middle-aged Japanese\
  \ salarymen looked to me from the next table over, its surface overcrowded (Is there\
  \ anything in Japan that isn\u2019t jam-packed, I thought) with Sapporo bottles\
  \ and stacked small plates of Karaage chicken and edamame shells. An enquiry into\
  \ one\u2019s unaccompanied state is, after all, a question that parents warn their\
  \ children about if ever approached by strangers. As a twenty-four year old female\
  \ on her first solo trip, tickets defiantly booked against the wishes of helicopter\
  \ parents and conservative friends, I was bristling for adventure, yet vigilant\
  \ of revealing one\u2019s solitary status.  \n \nI look up from my journal, where\
  \ I'd been keeping a fastidious account of the trip - down to detailed sketches\
  \ of the restaurants I had visited, and lists of must-see sights I\u2019d ticked\
  \ off. Notes that were woefully lacking in actual human contact - and now, four\
  \ human specimens presented themselves. \u201CWould you like to join us?\u201D The\
  \ same man in the group spoke again, a slight American accent now more obvious,\
  \ while the other three nodded politely. In comparison, the chaos of the Shibuya\
  \ crossing seemed safer than the unpredictability of strangers.\n \nTravelling solo\
  \ as a woman is a toss-up between risk calculation and trusting your gut instinct.\
  \ This time, I choose the latter, and boldly plant myself in the chair they had\
  \ pulled up for me.\n \nTwo of them spoke only Japanese but had belly laughs that\
  \ didn\u2019t require translation. Another had experience with American business\
  \ clients and spoke mostly in formalities \u2013 \u201CHow are you?\u201D \u201C\
  It\u2019s a pleasure meeting you.\u201D  Then our mutual interpreter, Go-San, a\
  \ charismatic man who grew up in Japan but went to college in Hawaii, where he met\
  \ his Japanese-American wife who moved to Tokyo with him. He embodied a cross-cultural\
  \ identity that, as a Singaporean transplanted to Australia, I could relate to.\
  \ All of them were twice my age and expressed a parental concern yet genuine admiration\
  \ for me for travelling alone. Thankfully, nothing inappropriate was said or done.\
  \ My trust was cemented.\n \nI mention that I am in the midst of setting up a caf\xE9\
  \ back home and had come out here to gain inspiration \u2013 and find out they are\
  \ property developers looking to open a hostel for young travellers. I was exactly\
  \ their target audience, while they had scores of free business advice for me. In\
  \ twenty minutes, our shared entrepreneurial zeal made us equals at the table \u2013\
  \ though with wildly different financial portfolios.\n \nThey enquire what and where\
  \ I\u2019d eaten so far in Japan. Food, after all, is a universal language. All\
  \ express dissatisfaction that I\u2019d only eaten at top-rated TripAdvisor spots,\
  \ generically good but representing only a shell of authentic Tokyo cuisine. I quickly\
  \ win back their approval by ordering another round of Yamazaki 12, neat, and end\
  \ up with a list of the best local ramen shops.\n \nGo-San takes the moment to invite\
  \ me out to dinner with him and his wife, kindly allowing me the choice of saying\
  \ no should I feel apprehensive. Later that week, I end up accepting the offer and\
  \ it turns out to be the best meal I\u2019ll have in Japan \u2013 a dimly lit sake\
  \ restaurant down a basement in glitzy Roppongi Hills, not a single word of English\
  \ on their menu and untraceable in all my Google searches afterwards. This is where\
  \ I first try Tamago Gohan \u2013 hot rice with one perfect raw egg spiked with\
  \ soy sauce \u2013 a moreish Japanese comfort dish that I\u2019ll replicate at home\
  \ for years after.\n \n\u201CCome, come, let\u2019s kanbai!\u201D The intonation\
  \ of the word \u201Ckanpai\u201D is similar to \u201Cganbei\u201D in my Chinese\
  \ mother tongue, so I automatically lift my glass to join them in a cheer so raucous\
  \ that the others in the restaurant turn curiously to stare. \n\nAs we clink our\
  \ glasses together, I realise that the revelry of raising a toast is a shared statement\
  \ of honour \u2013 and that night, I experienced the best of its kind, one that\
  \ declared a welcome and connection across cultures, ages and origins."
