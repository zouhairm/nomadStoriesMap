Text: "\u201CWhrrr, whrrr whrrr,\u201D Marcos called, increasingly loud each time,\
  \ \u201Ctoh-kee!\u201D He and Vito laughed again at their mimicry of the grey, orange-spotted\
  \ gecko. Known as a toh-kee, the large gecko\u2019s distinctive call could be heard\
  \ in many buildings at night.\n\nMore laughter, then Marcos translated that the\
  \ name for a smaller local gecko is teh-kee, also after its call, and colloquially\
  \ used as a term for attractive girls.\n\nWe were travelling from Dili to Los Palos,\
  \ at the far tip of East Timor, to make contacts and arrangements for future work.\
  \ The thin coast road carried us between the calm blue sea on our left and the mountains\
  \ rising steeply on our right, their sharp contours softened by forest cover.\n\n\
  Marcos was dedicated and reliable as project assistant, his intelligence sparked\
  \ with a dry sense of humour. Vito carried an aura of joy, his smile a constant\
  \ beneath his unruly curly hair as he drove. They spent much of the trip laughing\
  \ and chatting about their weekend, friends and would-be-girl friends.\n\nOver the\
  \ Christmas period, Marcos had not come to work for a few days. When he returned\
  \ his explanation was simple, \u201CI was making the nativity scene.\u201D These\
  \ Christian scenes were part of local tradition, each family or business making\
  \ a new one every year to display. Both men would claim to be Catholic if asked\
  \ directly. Both would attend one of the many churches on Sundays. Catholicism had\
  \ been introduced by the Portuguese after their arrival in the 16th century, but\
  \ had not replaced the local animism. East Timor declared independence from Portugal\
  \ in 1975. Just nine days later, Indonesia invaded. When it required all people\
  \ to identify with one of the dominant religions, most Timorese chose Catholicism,\
  \ due to its familiarity, and perhaps to avoid the Muslim religion of the occupying\
  \ powers.\n\nChurches were well attended on Sundays, and Los Palos was no different.\
  \ The church doors remained open; people clustered at the entrance to hear the service.\n\
  \nA local family gave us a place to camp in their yard, and invited us to join their\
  \ supper of corn soup with sambal. Each family made their own, and the recipe varied\
  \ greatly. Vito added some to his food, and as the sweat on his forehead collected\
  \ then ran down his face, his eyes gradually became redder, glistening with tears,\
  \ until the tears, too, ran down over his brown skin, now glowing and flushed.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you OK?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s good!\u201D he declared, before\
  \ turning to our hosts and switching to rapid Tetum, asking to buy some.\n\nHeading\
  \ west again after a successful trip, the mood was as calm as the sea now on our\
  \ right. We had two bottles of local sambal carefully stored for transit, and had\
  \ made good contacts for our work the following month. I watched as dolphins swam\
  \ in the shallow water. A chattering flock of small birds rose from the grass along\
  \ the road on our left, crossing in front of the car. There was a dull thud as one\
  \ of them did not make it.\n\nVito stopped the car, got out and quietly said, \u201C\
  I won\u2019t be long.\u201D\n\nTurning slightly in my seat I watched as he walked\
  \ the short distance back to where the dead bird lay on the road. He knelt down\
  \ and gently picked it up, took it to the side and laid it among the grass. He took\
  \ a handful of grass to cover it, then stood with his head down for a few minutes.\n\
  \n\u201CI had to say sorry,\u201D was his simple explanation when he returned.\n\
  \nIn his young life, he had known only Indonesian occupation until the recent peace.\
  \ But their oppression had not crushed his compassion. The Portuguese had introduced\
  \ Catholicism, but after centuries it remained a minor religion. Beneath the surface,\
  \ this fledgling country, where Catholic churches overflow on Sundays, was, at its\
  \ heart, still deeply animist. With an income, prospects and interested in chasing\
  \ girls, this young man had taken the time to honour the life of a small bird, and\
  \ apologise for ending its life so abruptly."
