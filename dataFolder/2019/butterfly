Text: "There I am, sitting behind the computer, trying to receive pleasure from the\
  \ things that I\u2019m doing. The nothingness of the clock reminding me how time\
  \ seems stuck like my surroundings. It\u2019s Thursday and I still have a full day\
  \ left before my two days of freedom. Like a prisoner longing for days of freedom,\
  \ ignoring my heart, while it\u2019s crying out to me. Once in a while I do listen\
  \ to my heart and this time it told me to call in sick the next day to distract\
  \ myself from my daily life struggles. \n\nWaking up with a smile on my face ready\
  \ to travel to the other side of the Netherlands to cry out on my mom\u2019s shoulders\
  \ all the depression of a month internship from my fourth attempt at studies. Trying\
  \ to fit in with what they call society. On the train I can not stop staring out\
  \ of the window at the trees as we speed along knowing that I\u2019m getting closer\
  \ and closer.\n\nJust before arriving home, magic happened. Prrt prrt my phone vibrates\
  \ in my pocket, it\u2019s Tarzan. The gorgeous Greek, with whom I spent my holiday\
  \ in Greece, racing on the back of his motorbike, whirling our bodies together on\
  \ hidden beaches and staring at him while making the best cocktails that made me\
  \ forget his real name over and over again. Of all people, he texted me: Hi Sophie!\
  \ How are you? After not being in contact for five months. My lungs stopped breathing,\
  \ my heart beating so loud I couldn\u2019t hear my own thoughts. Ok\xE9 take a second,\
  \ breathe in and let\u2019s listen to what my mind has to say: Why is he texting\
  \ me? What is going on? Is this the universe calling out to me?\n\nForgetting the\
  \ reason why I called in sick in the first place. The second reason took over: How\
  \ to deal with a Greek god texting me? I had to call him to figure out what was\
  \ going on. I explained to him my unhappy situation to which he responded with the\
  \ life-changing question: If you feel depressed, why don\u2019t you just come and\
  \ visit me in Thailand? So there it was, a big explosion in my mind. My need to\
  \ cry out all my frustration turned into a lot of confusion about whether or not\
  \ I am excited or scared. The excitement won the battle and the lucky person I am,\
  \ having the best mom in the world, giving me all her blessings. Finally, please\
  \ go taste the freedom, follow your heart and experience the world.\n\nThe one-way\
  \ flight was booked. I gave myself two weeks to get everything done, for my unplanned\
  \ unorganized trip, saying goodbye to my family and friends, quit my studies and\
  \ buy a backpack. \n\nIn a blink of an eye, I sat on the plane to Thailand with\
  \ a massive smile on my face and the biggest sensation of curiosity rushing through\
  \ my veins. Stepping out of my comfort zone, moving into total freedom without knowing\
  \ what tomorrow might bring. After a week with the potential love of my life I figured\
  \ out this was just a first step into a new chapter. The beginning of my journey\
  \ to the beauty of my true self. \n\nFor three on-going years I\u2019ve travelled\
  \ the world making amazing connections with people like never before, going on thrilling\
  \ adventures, being mesmerized by the fascinating Pachamama but also going through\
  \ a lot of tough feelings like loneliness, failing, insecurity and so many many\
  \ more. Traveling has been the most effective school, helping me grow from a caterpillar\
  \ into a backpacking adventurous butterfly that loves taking a leap into the unknown."
