Text: "At the age of 22, on October 2014 I left Italy, my native land, for Australia:\
  \ it was one of my life\u2019s dream since I attended high-school and I finally\
  \ made it. Once arrived in Sydney, I started to look for a job and an apartment:\
  \ the first months, I have been living in a shared flat with some roommates from\
  \ different parts of the world. With one in particular, I used to get on well: he\
  \ is the first Chilean I met and, since the beginning, he used to talk to me a lot\
  \ about his country. I am pretty sure that almost nobody, me included at that time,\
  \ is aware of the fact that Chile is the longest (Antarctic included) yet narrow\
  \ country in the world: you can be surrounded by frozen mountains and lakes in the\
  \ south and take a 5-hour flight off to Calama into the driest place on earth, the\
  \ desert in the north!\n\nAfter meeting lots of Chilean by the time and listening\
  \ to them about their country, I started feeling I had to go to Chile: four years\
  \ later, booking my flight to Santiago made me the happiest girl ever.\nOn 28th\
  \ of December, I said bye-bye to the cold and foggy sky of Venice and I flew for\
  \ a day, due to the distance and two layovers: at my arrival, Santiago received\
  \ me with its hot and sunny weather, which was already a perfect welcome to begin!\
  \ A mix of emotions overwhelmed me: I was finally in Chile and I was going to catch\
  \ up with my friends, who I met during my experiences abroad and I shared such good\
  \ moments with, I was still unable to believe it! But what amazed me most was the\
  \ warmth I have been welcomed with: I obviously got enough hugs and kisses by my\
  \ friends, but I didn\u2019t expect to receive the same treatments by their families\
  \ too! While at their home, everybody did the best to make me feel comfortable as\
  \ I was at my home, making me try typical Chilean food and wine: I ate the best\
  \ avocado (which they call \u201Cpalta\u201D) and cherries ever, specifically bought\
  \ for me; another day I finally tasted the famous \u201CCasillero del Diablo\u201D\
  \ and I had lots of chocolate, cheese and sauces that I cannot either remember the\
  \ names! My friend\u2019s mum invited me for dinner and she cooked \u201Cempanadas\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cpastel de choclo\u201D for this occasion and I felt cuddled like they\
  \ were my family. I have been to Valpara\xEDso for New Year\u2019s Eve, which is\
  \ famous for the pyrotechnical show at midnight and it has definitely been worth\
  \ it: all the people reunited in advance in the picturesque squares and all contemplating\
  \ the fireworks launched from the three main cities, Valpo, Vi\xF1a and Conc\xF3\
  n, reflecting down to the water. Back to Santiago a few days later, where all my\
  \ friends live, I spent my time visiting the city and enjoying every minute with\
  \ them, especially the \u201Conce chilena\u201D: a kind of break/dinner, eating\
  \ a marraqueta or some anticuchos with a cup of tea or coffee. Then, I went three\
  \ days to San Pedro de Atacama, one of the most touristic places, located in an\
  \ arid upland plain of the Andes. The landscapes I faced simply left me speechless:\
  \ deserts, salt plain, high plateau lagoons, Vulcans, geysers and hot springs; but\
  \ once more, it blew me away that everybody is so kind and helpful, even with tourists.\
  \ As I was by myself, my friends helped me to plan my trip and gave me advices,\
  \ so I was already prepared for everything; however, the personnel at the hostel,\
  \ the tour guides, other Chileans travelling there and \u201CAtacame\xF1os\u201D\
  - native of the place- always smiling took care of me by giving recommendations\
  \ and chatting with me.\n\nI had heard Chile is a really enchanting country that\
  \ deserves to be visited, and I have to say it is true; but I strongly believe its\
  \ major beauty are Chilean themselves, with their kindness and heartiness, and this\
  \ trip has confirmed how lucky I have been the previous years to meet my Chilean\
  \ friends."
