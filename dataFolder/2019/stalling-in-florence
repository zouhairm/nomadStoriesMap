Text: "The first thing you should know is that it has been a few years since I have\
  \ driven a manual car.\nMy girlfriend and I travelled to Florence from Rome, her\
  \ siblings are arriving from the Amalfi Coast and somewhere amidst the tourists,\
  \ noise and summer heat of Stazione di Santa Maria Novella her mother and stepfather\
  \ are waiting. The plan is to meet at the station, then take two cars to the small\
  \ village of Marcialla, about 30 kilometres from the city centre. \nThe car rental\
  \ office is a short walk made clumsy by our suitcase wheels on the paved streets.\
  \ Upon arrival we are led to boxy, emerald green Fiat. It is quintessentially Italian,\
  \ and we quickly fall in love with it. My girlfriend, her sister and I will take\
  \ the Fiat, the others pile into a Ford station wagon a few spots behind us. \n\u201C\
  We\u2019ll follow you!\u201D shouts my girlfriend\u2019s stepfather as he ducks\
  \ into the driver seat. I later learnt he had opted to forgo a GPS in favour of\
  \ following us. This detail is small, but important. \nI tentatively test the clutch,\
  \ then lean forward to find the indicator. The windscreen wipers burst to life as\
  \ I make a discovery\u2014European cars have the indicator on the opposite side\
  \ of the wheel to cars back home. \nThe first time I stall is just after reversing\
  \ out of the parking spot. I nervously laugh it off and edge the Fiat towards the\
  \ exit gate. The car stalls again as I fumble with the window and then the ticket.\
  \ Fearing we won\u2019t make it before the boom gate swings back down, I crunch\
  \ the gear stick into neutral and roll out into the busy streets of Florence. \n\
  The second thing you should know is that in Italy you drive on the right side of\
  \ the road\u2014which is to say, the wrong side for an Australian driver.\nCyclists\
  \ and scooters slip past on either side, a small pug mounted on the handlebars turning\
  \ to stare as its owner weaves her bike around our lurching vehicle. \nWe bunny\
  \ hop to a roundabout, stall again mid-way and fall to the mercy of car horns behind\
  \ us.\nI lunge the Fiat into a one-way street, the oncoming truck driver wagging\
  \ his finger at us in disapproval as he is forced to a halt. \nMy girlfriend leaps\
  \ into action. \nWe swap sides, she puts the car into reverse as I sink into the\
  \ passenger seat. She brings us back around facing the roundabout, then through\
  \ to the other side and out across the Arno river. She doesn\u2019t stall once.\
  \ \nAs cars and bicycles give way to rolling Tuscan hills, we all become acutely\
  \ aware of one thing. The remainder of our party have been left behind, and in our\
  \ panic, they now have no one to follow for the next 40 minutes of the drive. \n\
  Resigned to this, we concentrate intently on our newly appointed roles of navigator\
  \ and driver. A long dirt road eventually leads to a narrow gateway, and we arrive\
  \ at our villa feeling relieved but exhausted by the stress. \nIn the end, the second\
  \ car makes it not too long after us\u2014with the help of some exorbitant data\
  \ roaming fees. \nWe all settle in the pool to unwind, and as my embarrassment from\
  \ the day\u2019s events recedes, we watch the sun lower itself over the postcard\
  \ view of vineyards and tower-topped hills. \nThat evening will mark the start of\
  \ the most wonderful time in Italy, where the worst things that could go wrong end\
  \ up being the best things to laugh about when we finally return home. I wouldn\u2019\
  t change anything about it\u2026except maybe to hire an automatic car next time."
