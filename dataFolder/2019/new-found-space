Text: "My story begins in Morocco. \nThis place blew all expectations.\n\nIt illuminated\
  \ into a place of wonder, colour, femininity, masculinity, luxurious materials,\
  \ sand deserts, and wild seas all thanks to making a local connection with it's\
  \ people. \n\nMy one week turned into four weeks and boy was it one hell of a ride.\
  \ \n\nI had met one of my Australian friends in Agadir and we hired a car to go\
  \ north along the coast with the aim to surf and explore the main attractions. \n\
  \nThe week went by and our last stop together was in Casablanca. Here we stayed\
  \ at a surf house for one night and my friend flew out the following day. \nI was\
  \ left to plan my itinerary on my own and I was unsure whether to catch a flight\
  \ from Casablanca to Italy or catch a bus and start heading north to ferry into\
  \ southern Spain. \nSo that morning I went for a run along the beach in Dar Bouazza\
  \ and beated out a pretty hard workout because I had just ended a relationship with\
  \ my boyfriend. It was fairly mutual but at the same time was disheartening because\
  \ we had been together for a couple of years and he had planned to meet my friend\
  \ and I here. \n\nAnyway while I was laying on the beach stretching a man approached\
  \ me and asked if I could be a PT for his wife who had become a mother a year ago\
  \ and hadn't exercised since. \n\nI assured the guy that I wasn't a personal trainer\
  \ and probably wouldn't be up for the role because I was travelling alone at the\
  \ moment and was going to head north (despite no real commitments or reasons to).\
  \ \n\nHe was insistent and offered subsidised accommodation in exchange as well\
  \ as an option to just personal train her the following morning. So I said yes and\
  \ met the following morning at 8am. \n\nI had no idea who to expect. \n\nHer name\
  \ was Sab, she was 22 years old, had a one year old baby, looked fairly fit and\
  \ loved photography. She had been living in Morocco since day 1 and identified herself\
  \ as Muslim but chose not to wear headwear. \n\nWe clicked with all topics and she\
  \ could speak fluent English, French and Arabic. \n\nThe one day turned into 2 weeks\
  \ and it was the highlight of my trip. \n\nShe treated me like a family member and\
  \ we became great friends in an instant.\n\nFrom cooking classes to making bracelets\
  \ from beads, to booking me in for a hair cut, teaching me French and Arabic, and\
  \ showing the best hidden places to shop in Casablanca. \n\nIt was amazing and a\
  \ local connection I never thought was possible. \n\nI partook in teaching surfing\
  \ and boogie boarding for their surf school as well as Sab encouraged me into a\
  \ photo shoot where she dressed me up like Frida and took pictures on the beach.\
  \ Funnily enough she entered these into a local magazine and won a money prize for\
  \ best photograph. \n\nVery surprising considering I hate photos being taken of\
  \ myself and I don't consider myself photogenic at all. \n\nThe trip ended on a\
  \ high and we're still in contact today, 2 years later. \n\nI'm hoping to visit\
  \ her if I get this scholarship to Portugal."
