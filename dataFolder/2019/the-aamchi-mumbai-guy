Text: "What could be more worst than travelling to India\u2019s economical hub for\
  \ your sisters cancer treatment.I still remember those shady days of 1997 when me\
  \ and my family were visiting Mumbai frequently for treatment of my sister.My sister\
  \ was on the third stage of Hodgkin disease and we were getting her treated from\
  \ Tata Memorial Hospital at Lower Parel Mumbai.\n\nThose days have left a bunch\
  \ of memories for my lifetime and some people to cherish forever.As my sister was\
  \ on chemotherapy initially so we have to be based at Mumbai temporarily.Our journey\
  \ started by finding a proper accommodation for our family,considering the closeness\
  \ to hospital we took a lodge in Lower Parel.That lodge was in the commercial area\
  \ of Parel with residents on first and second floor.The lodge manager Mr Rama was\
  \ a typical South Indian guy with always beautiful smile on his face.Our frequent\
  \ visit to Mumbai created a deep bond with the local guys.As I was a kid at that\
  \ time and was very attractive as a child people starting loving me.On the first\
  \ floor Elizabeth aunty was staying with his 54 year mentally retarded son Albert.Me\
  \ and my sister use to visit her place whenever we were free.She use to feed us\
  \ with some tasty pancakes and kaju katli.She was very kind to us and always treat\
  \ us with love and affection.Slowly and gradually our bond become deeper.\n\nAlso\
  \ in the hotel compound there was a base kitchen of a sweet shop.There was a guy\
  \ named Shinde who always use to say Ammchi Mumbai and ask \u201Ckab aaya gaon se\
  \ \u201C and we use to reply arre \u201Chum gaon me nahi shehar me rehte hai\u201D\
  . I always feel dishearten whenever I see Albert as he was aunty\u2019s only child\
  \ and aunty was all alone.We have explored Mumbai in and out during our frequent\
  \ visits starting from Juhi Champati to Haji Ali dargah,Essex world to Gateway of\
  \ India.I was deeply in love with Pav bhaji and Cutting Chai.Also the taste of Malad\
  \ ki special lassi is still fresh In my mind.Slowly and gradually I started feeling\
  \ a sense of belonging to that place and Mumbai.That local connection was prominent\
  \ and people started treating us like their family.\n\nAfter three years my sisters\
  \ cancer was cured and we were there probably our last visit.My entire family was\
  \ so happy as my sister has won that battle of her life.With great joy we were once\
  \ again in Ammchi Mumbai,but that visit gave a greater sorrow to my life.As we reached\
  \ Mumbai me and my sister immediately went to Elizabeth aunty\u2019s house but found\
  \ that her house is locked.We we\u2019re visiting there after an year or so.We immediately\
  \ gone to Shinde and asked about aunty.Who then told that aunty and Albert are no\
  \ more,this shocked me to my core.We started crying and I was not in a position\
  \ to believe that.Our entire happiness turned into sadness and I felt a great loss\
  \ in my life.I am still in love with Elizabeth aunty and wish peace for her \n\n\
  Those trips to Mumbai has given a lifetime memories for me,and I greatly believe\
  \ that local connections help"
