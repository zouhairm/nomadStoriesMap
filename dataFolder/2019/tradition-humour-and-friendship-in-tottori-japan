Text: "What does respects means for you? This is, honestly, an awkward question to\
  \ ask to a Japanese, especially when you\u2019re both naked and submerged in an\
  \ Onsen in Tottori, a small province three hours away from Kyoto. The question actually\
  \ surprises him, even though he lives in a country where respect is one of the deepest\
  \ roots and honour could even mean suicide by Hara-Kiri, a painful, yet purifying\
  \ way of sacrificing oneself for a greater cause, but after thinking it for a couple\
  \ of seconds he finally answers: \u201Cit\u2019s a life philosophy, that gives you\
  \ more obligations than rights\u201D, I can not help smiling and understanding why,\
  \ at the end, they\u2019ve let in a tattooed man, which usually is a distinction\
  \ of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, which of course, I have no relationship with.\
  \ I\u2019m feeling the temperature is rising and decide to go out for a cold and\
  \ refreshing shower, as the tradition states it, you should take some cold showers\
  \ every 15-20 min for stress relieving, muscle relaxation and skin beautifying.\
  \ \nWhen I\u2019m back, I decide that my interlocutor looks comfortable enough to\
  \ continue our conversation, so I ask about the nightlife and his answer is, at\
  \ first, disappointing, it is actually not vibrant and quite small, but still, he\
  \ offers to take me and as a solo traveller I accept immediately; we keep the conversation\
  \ around Ramen and the little tourism in the town until we decide we\u2019re ready\
  \ to continue our journey.\nWhile I mention the vintage furniture, we make our way\
  \ out through the colourful restaurants and shops, Haru starts to explain the touristic\
  \ highlights of the place with mixed funny stories that, as a business man, he encounters\
  \ very often, like that time a guy who had some Japanese knowledge offered his seat\
  \ to an older woman on the train and said confidently \u201CDouozo sawatte kusadai\u201D\
  , which means something like: go ahead, touch me, after my friend explained the\
  \ real meaning of his words, he was so embarrassed, he decided to step off the bus\
  \ and walk.\nBetween temples, traditional food and humour, we arrive soon to The\
  \ Sakaemachi Hall, one of the only Pub\u2019s in the city, and it really looks like\
  \ an English Pub, but serving sushi instead of fish and chips, I ask for a beer,\
  \ but my enthusiastic guide wants me to try sake, of course, the typical Japanese\
  \ rice, alcoholic beverage, which I accept grateful and even cheer Kanpai proudly\
  \ when it arrives, it\u2019s one of my few Japanese words and it makes Haru smile\
  \ while he takes the small cup of hot sake and drink it with a big sip.\nWhile the\
  \ sake keeps running and the smell of fish fills the atmosphere, we start speaking\
  \ about being gay in Japan, unexpectedly, he feels quite comfortable with it, even\
  \ though his family is not aware and he prefers to keep it like that. Modern Japan\
  \ is more tolerant and has more open scenes in big cities like Tokyo, but some gay\
  \ and lesbian women even prefer to marry with a person from the opposite sex and\
  \ hide it, mainly because it\u2019s important for families and respect for your\
  \ family is one of the main values Japanese people are proud of. I smile, not particularly\
  \ at his words, mostly because I\u2019m experiencing the opportunity to meet a modern\
  \ Japanese that still retains its traditional values and makes me feel so pleased\
  \ to learn that much of a culture in just half a day in Tottori.\nHaru is one of\
  \ the most charming talkers I\u2019ve ever met, but tomorrow I\u2019m travelling\
  \ to Hiroshima, so I decide it\u2019 time to go back, I say goodbye and even hug\
  \ my new friend Haru. I\u2019m glad my Ryokan is close, I walk in sliding the door,\
  \ prepare my own futon and think about the marvelous places I\u2019ve seen, full\
  \ of culture, heritage and tradition, but even more, his people, who definitely\
  \ are one of the kindest I've met and even made me reflect, how important is to\
  \ learn respect and understand you only gain rights when you have clear your obligations\
  \ with the world, wise lesson for a globe trotter."
