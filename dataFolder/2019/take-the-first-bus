Text: "Travel! whenever we hear this word, we think about going to another continent,\
  \ country or city .But did you ever think about the possibilty of spending an interesting\
  \ journey just in your own city? who knows! maybe there is a story hiding just in\
  \ the corner or behind your door and waiting for you to discover it! \nWell.. that's\
  \ what happened to me that day! actually I didn't plan for it.. and till the last\
  \ moment I was sooo hesitant, there was a fight inside my head between the side\
  \ of me that wanted to take the risk and the other side that loved to stay calm\
  \ in its comfortzone! Still have no clue about what I'm talking about? lol I had\
  \ an interview with the organization Aiesec in my first week of my first year in\
  \ university, it was a whole different city and I was still trying to remember the\
  \ road between my faculty and the dormitory.. So what? at the last moment I screamed\
  \ : \" LET'S TAKE THE FIRST BUS! \" It's true that I didn't know the place, I was\
  \ alone, and I hadn't enough confidence.. but also till when? it's time to learn!\
  \ and sometimes the chance comes only once!\nI took the bus after I asked some people\
  \ about it, I sat in my place while my heart was dancing and singing Bom Bom Bom\
  \ lol\nI reached the place where they asked me to come and it was a huge faculty\
  \ full of crossroads, trees, and few people passing by me.. I stopped two girls\
  \ and tried to describe where I wanted to go to them.. and then before I finish\
  \ my question I felt someone shaking my shoulder, she was a pretty girl saying :\
  \ \" Oh I'm going to the same place! let's go together \" ..she didn't really know\
  \ how to get there so we were lost together haha but then we got to know each other\
  \ and we both had a new friend! After taking a tour around the faculty, she called\
  \ one of her friends using my phone and he came to catch us! inside the building\
  \ they gave me a ticket with the number 4, and I took a seat watching everyone playing\
  \ games, laughing and having a beautiful time as a family! to be honest, I felt\
  \ kind of lonely since I don't know anyone and it was hard for me to take the first\
  \ step! \nI entered the room where the interview was, there she was a very nice\
  \ girl who asked me few questions. We had a wonderful time, at least me haha, and\
  \ then I left the place after wishing a nice day for everyone.. I went back to my\
  \ room and that's how the adventure was! Are you wondering if they have accepted\
  \ me or not? lol well that's another story :P"
