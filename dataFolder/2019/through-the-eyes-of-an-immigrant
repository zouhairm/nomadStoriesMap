Text: "She scurried out to us yelling, dozens of eyes stared back at her as we disembarked\
  \ the small minibus, for the final destination of the day.  Her feet clad for all\
  \ to see, in pink furry slippers, a chequered tea towel in her hands.\n \u201CWhat\
  \ do yis want?\u201D she inquired looking at each one of us, as Udu, the closest\
  \ to her, tried to respond. \n \"Not you, anyone but you!\" she barked at him in\
  \ a thick Dublin accent. \n My heart broke at that moment, could she really speak\
  \ with such disdain to a fellow human she had never before even met?\n \"I am in\
  \ charge here, we are a group of writers\u201D, he offered with a smile, an intonation\
  \ of Irish tones wrapped around his African born tongue. This, a unique blend of\
  \ inflection he had accumulated whilst growing up on the very street we all now\
  \ stood. As others in the group began to chime in, explaining our mere existence.\
  \ We stood like paparazzi, pens poised instead of cameras. Writing pads at the ready.\n\
  \ \"Yis are writers you say? She softens a little. As she scans the group, her tea\
  \ towel flapping in the breeze. \n\nUdu, a distinguished writer and teacher of the\
  \ group explains that we are on a mini bus tour of the city he grew up in. His family\
  \ having emigrated from Africa in the eighties had moved to Dublin, \u201CI grew\
  \ up on this very street\u201D, he illustrates with both his hands, fingers pointing\
  \ toward a corner house.  She responds with disdain, \u201CI\u2019ve been living\
  \ on dis street for many years, I\u2019d remember you\u201D, she goes on to instruct,\
  \ \u201Cit\u2019s the next street over ye want\u201D. The housewife sweeps her hand\
  \ in the air toward the sky. \u201CThey are where the council houses are\u201D.\
  \ \u201CPerhaps I got the wrong road\u201D, Udu replies calmly, as the group digests\
  \ their exchange. \n\n\u201CIreland is not what it used to be\u201D, she goes on\
  \ to state, to no one in particular. As she references an internal notion that we\
  \ are somehow dismantled from the land from whence she came. \"It's not here yis\
  \ need to be\" she spits, as she stands with firm hands on her hips.\n\nMy heart\
  \ weeps for her soul as we duly take our cue and the group turns to leave her cosy\
  \ cul de sac. We board the minibus one last time and one by one the driver counts\
  \ each head that disappears into a seat. As our writer\u2019s bus trundles off,\
  \ Udu, curious of his own memory bank, peers out the window and reads the adjacent\
  \ street sign, it reads \u2018Tallaght Vale\u2019. He smiles to himself, remembering\
  \ the summers of clambering up the towering oak tree that after thirty years still\
  \ stands. Strong and proud, overlooking the corner of his old neighbourhood. Udu\
  \ and his writers had indeed visited the street he grew up on as a boy and they\
  \ knew it. He however chooses to say no more and as the wheels gradually come to\
  \ a slow across the Beckett Bridge, we arrive back in Dublin\u2019s fair city. The\
  \ tour is over. As the group disperses, I wander to the nearby stone banks of the\
  \ capitals River Liffey. Taking out my pen and paper, I scribble the words, Dublin\
  \ through the eyes of an Immigrant... \n\nAt that very same moment, on the street\
  \ that Udu grew up on, a housewife breathes a sigh of relief. A glance at the clock\
  \ tells her it's time to get the dinner on, spuds on a Sunday.  Some things never\
  \ change."
