Text: "I threw down my hockey stick as my teammate gestured towards the stadium. Turning\
  \ to follow the direction of her arm, I saw my best friend, her copper-coloured\
  \ Medusa curls playing in the wind around her beaming face. This is a memory which\
  \ feels closer to cinema than reality. Writing about it now, I see it as though\
  \ a sentimental director ordered the background to fade into soft focus, leaving\
  \ only the unnaturally green close-cropped turf between us. She flew 3000 miles\
  \ to get there, I ran the last 100 metres. I have never run faster.  \n\nI found\
  \ my best friend before we were born, but I have found her \u2013 Olivia, my twin\
  \ \u2013 around the globe many times since. The day I abandoned my teammates to\
  \ throw myself into her arms was the first in a series of self-consciously cinematic\
  \ re-encounters we\u2019ve had since at 17, I packed up my books and ambitions and\
  \ left Glasgow, Scotland for Andover, Massachusetts and a scholarship to a boarding\
  \ school I had dreamed of for the past two years. Five weeks into the semester,\
  \ exhausted and starved of accents which matched my own, I ran that 100 metres home\
  \ to her. The embarrassed, elated tears I was still shedding when I resumed my abandoned\
  \ post on the hockey field have resurged since then in Scotland, Chile and Spain.\
  \ \n\nIn a taxi three years later, my parents and I drove through the chaotic outskirts\
  \ of Santiago de Chile. From the cool interior, I caught my first glimpses of the\
  \ city: a horse casually flicking its tail in a garden on the other side of a rubbish-strewn\
  \ stream, the Mapocho River, more solid than liquid as it drowned in its own sediment\
  \ and finally, the utterly average Crowne Plaza Hotel, it\u2019s brazenly North\
  \ American architecture promising predictability.  And there she was again, my sister.\
  \ Her Medusa curls were shorter, her pale, Celtic skin burned a tender pink as she\
  \ rose from the lobby sofa and opened her arms wide. I only let go once I realised\
  \ my earring was caught in her t-shirt, metal and cloth protesting further departures.\
  \ \n\nSantiago is a chain smoker of a city, puffing out smog until the Andes are\
  \ only visible from the city streets if you squint through sunglasses. From the\
  \ upper floors of the hotel, however, the mountains began to take their irrational\
  \ shape, looking just as impossible as they had from the flight path which we\u2019\
  d carved over them. Think of mountains, then make them more of everything: more\
  \ erratic, more ragged, taller, more perfectly snow-capped, even in this, Santiago\u2019\
  s first sparks of a burning summer. \n\nLeaving the banalities of the hotel, we\
  \ entered Olivia\u2019s Santiago. She walked with ease and confidence in a city\
  \ full of people a head and shoulders shorter than her, who watched her as she went.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but join them. She moved and spoke like this was her home.\
  \ The street on which she lived was more akin to Disneyland than any city I\u2019\
  d seen before. There were dogs lazing on the patios of brightly coloured villas,\
  \ gothic-style houses complete with gargoyles and always the sound of music drifting\
  \ out from the dance studios and music schools which were her neighbours. As we\
  \ walked into her Casa Azul (Blue House) I found her again. Olivia, now an adult,\
  \ still mine but utterly her own person, came alive in her cramped and bright kitchen,\
  \ making a welcome meal for us. Her eyes jumped between simmering pans and empty\
  \ drinks glasses while her voice dashed from English to her new, Chilean-accented\
  \ Spanish. We had our first asado of our time together, spending the day getting\
  \ drunk on the sun and each other\u2019s company. \n\nSince then, I have lived in\
  \ Mexico and Spain, as well as my university city of Birmingham, England in eager\
  \ pursuit of my undergraduate degree. Olivia returned from Chile to make Manchester,\
  \ England her home once more and then, as is her wont, chose a new country and a\
  \ new reality in Madrid, Spain. With Olivia I am constantly living a clich\xE9 of\
  \ travelling, finding home again wherever I find her. Hopefully our flight paths\
  \ match up again soon."
