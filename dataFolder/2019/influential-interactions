Text: "I visited Europe for the first time in May 2018, and travelled solo. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to really interact with anyone in any personal way, to be honest. I\u2019\
  m an independent and introverted person, happy to do my own thing. There were small\
  \ moments that brought me joy: a tourist offering to take my photo with my phone\
  \ as I struggled to take a good selfie in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,\
  \  another solo female traveler who lent me a bit of cooking oil in the poorly stocked\
  \ hostel kitchen in Amsterdam... But I\u2019d have to say, for unexpected personal\
  \ interactions, my two day stop in Budapest definitely had the most impact.\n\n\
  I had my worst personal interaction on the trip: fighting with the receptionist\
  \ to get my money back at the hostel  I pre-booked, because it was sketchy and dirty.\
  \ On my way out, she said \u201CI doubt you\u2019ll find anywhere better to stay.\u201D\
  \ I told her I\u2019d take my chances. I\u2019m so glad I did. With some unreliable\
  \ wifi and frantic search on Hostelworld, I managed to find another hostel that\
  \ had a dorm bed available.\n\nAt breakfast the next morning, I met two other girls\
  \ staying in a different room. Their names were Mariela and Jidapha, and they were\
  \ talking about the ruin bars in Budapest, and how they were thinking of going that\
  \ night. I asked if they knew where one was, because I had been thinking of going\
  \ that night, too. They didn\u2019t know, but we decided we could all try to find\
  \ a ruin bar together. I couldn\u2019t believe how perfectly that worked out! I\
  \ had no idea how to find one of these bars, and it was kind of a relief that I\u2019\
  d have company on the search.\n\nThe three of us met up later in the evening. A\
  \ third girl, Mariana, who was from another dorm in the hostel was also joining\
  \ us. Mariela said she\u2019d also invited her friend who knew where to find a ruin\
  \ bar. His name was Rodrigo, and he\u2019d been in Budapest for 6 months already.\n\
  \nOn the walk to the ruin bar (which I found out later was called Szimpla Kert),\
  \ we all talked a bit about our travels and our lives. Mariela was from Chile in\
  \ South America, and was here on a working holiday Visa for a job that needed native\
  \ Spanish speakers. Mariana was from Mexico, and traveling solo after graduating\
  \ from school. Jidapha was a teacher from Thailand, and just loved traveling whenever\
  \ she could. \n\nI found Rodrigo\u2019s story especially interesting. Rodrigo was\
  \ also from Chile, and in Budapest on a working holiday visa. Before this, he\u2019\
  d been to New Zealand and Montreal, Canada on a working holiday Visa.  He had a\
  \ degree in Political Science, knew 3 languages already, and was planning to go\
  \ to Belarus to learn Russian. I was super inspired. I wanted to have the same life\
  \ as him... working in new places, learning languages, living on a shoestring budget\
  \ but free to explore.\n\nI thought it was so crazy how all our separate paths brought\
  \ us to the same hostel at the same time. And how much different my few days in\
  \ Budapest would have been if I\u2019d stayed in the original, super sketchy hostel.\
  \ But there I was, trading stories, sharing food and drinks, and exploring the city\
  \ as if I was close friends with these people I\u2019d just met. I felt so inspired\
  \ by how they were able to make travel part of their lives, and courage to be solo\
  \ travelers.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the friends I met in Budapest.  We still\
  \ keep up with each other\u2019s travel experiences on social media. Rodrigo is\
  \ now my partner, and I went back to Europe in August 2018 to travel with him. And\
  \ now, I\u2019m on the cusp of leaving my job to follow my creative and travel dreams.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t think that two days and the stories of four people would influence\
  \ so much change in my life. But I\u2019m glad it did, and I\u2019m looking forward\
  \ to what interactions my next trip has in store."
