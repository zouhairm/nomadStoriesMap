Text: "My birthday, 17th September, 2018. I wanted to make it memorable. I was so\
  \ tired and pissed with my life. Was mentally exhausted. I left my husband after\
  \ consecutive tortures by him and his family. I knew that one thing can save my\
  \ life.. The hills.. I can sleep my whole life by looking at the hills 24x7.\n\n\
  I was accompanied by my mother and best friend Priyanka.\n\nWe took a train to NJP\
  \ from Kolkata and reached there next morning.It was tough situation as the roads\
  \ were blocked and everyone suggested to stay back there. But our destination was\
  \ Gangtok. We didn't leave hope and reached Siliguri. Finally it took us all the\
  \ day in the car. \n\nBut the journey was mesmerizing. It took our time but my love\
  \ for hills never let me feel bad. We were hungry but the scenic beauty and long\
  \ drive took all the pain away. \n\nWe reached the hotel around 8 pm and had a great\
  \ welcome by them. They offered us drink and made us feel comfortable at the room.\n\
  \nWell we found the room was a bit suffocating so we upgraded a hill faced room.\
  \ At the night.. It's the most beautiful feeling when u and hill are just talking\
  \ silently. How hill stands alone like me and takes all the pain. Nature is so beautiful.\
  \ Sikkim is a heaven on the earth.\n\nNext day,  we took a cab to Nathula. That\
  \ was a day with hills,  roads and Nepali songs. Can there be anything more beautiful\
  \ than this. My mother was so happy that I could see it on her face. She dressed\
  \ up as a young girl looked so so pretty. \n\nPriyanka was also excited, she was\
  \ looking through the window shield enjoying the breeze of the air. \n\nI was a\
  \ Lil depressed for what was happening in my life and also that Kanchanjangha was\
  \ covered by clouds. I was requesting lord Shiva to give me my birthday gift which\
  \ was a day later.\n\nWe reached Nathula,  it was high and my mom gave up to climb.\
  \  I asked he to wait and climb gradually. I went up alone as Priyanka also gave\
  \ up in sometime. It was heaven. I could see China,  border and there soldiers.\
  \ And the gate to greater Kailash. Even Bhutan was also wondering me,  how far is\
  \ that. If I could touch it. Photography was strictly prohibited  so I wanted to\
  \ click the photos through my eyes. After that we went to the lake down,  and had\
  \ boat ride. All 4 of us were in the middle of the lake and could see we were surrounded\
  \ by the hills. I forgot everything,  everything of my life. I want to go back there\
  \ everyday.. \n\nBaba Mandir,  our next destination.  This is a place where Shiv\
  \ Hi is blessing us through his divine form of white statue. That's the most peaceful\
  \ view I have ever had in my life. We took photos there. I put myself on Priyanka's\
  \ back to give her the reminder about my weight which was increasing day by day.\
  \ She was lagging.. And the breeze of air was touching her hair. I saw mom sitting\
  \ alone. She was probably lost in the nature. I know that my mama loves sea but\
  \ she loves me. She loves everything that I love. She was happy to see me laughing.\
  \ I went up-to her and gave her a hug. We clicked a photo which is there on my mobile\
  \ screen. \n\nNext day we had to leave for airport. I was still so upset that two\
  \ days I couldn't see the kanchanjangha. The driver already disappointed me last\
  \ day that 17th September will be also a cloudy day. Come on.. This was my birthday.\
  \ I requested,  prayed lord Shiva. We just took the turn towards the hill,  you\
  \ don't believe that I could see Kanchanjangha. Yes,  unbelievable. It was a clear\
  \ sky and the beautiful peace made by God was there at front of me. I cried,  I\
  \ laughed and jumped .  I did all the madness I could do. And of course loads of\
  \ photos.\n\nMemories that will last forever ."
