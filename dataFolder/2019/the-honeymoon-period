Text: "I had often heard many people say that the world is such a small place yet\
  \ I used to wonder how. To me it was a vast place, a gigantic area to discover and\
  \ explore. My journey started from Abu Dhabi. Being born and raised in Pakistan,\
  \ eldest of 4 girls, I got married to a handsome guy who worked in Abu Dhabi. Right\
  \ after the wedding I moved with him not knowing what I would find. I have to say\
  \ that they were the amazing 6 months of my life. I had been to UAE before for a\
  \ visit but that was for a short period and I was a tourist. Going there to make\
  \ it a home was a completely different story.\nAbu Dhabi is 1.5 hours drive away\
  \ from Dubai and extremely diverse. You will find people from all over the world.\
  \ The weather can get as hot as +50C but you can get door to door services and won\u2019\
  t feel the heat at all. There are many convenient options for Taxi services like\
  \ Emirates and National and the fares were reasonable too. The malls are beautiful\
  \ and worth visiting. One could find any cuisine they wished for and most of the\
  \ times pretty authentic. Initially I dint know where to go and what to do, but\
  \ one fine day I decided to take a walk and explore. You can find all kinds of shops\
  \ on the streets including grocery stores, 1Dirham shops all the way to exquisite\
  \ gold stores. But one should remember to keep water with them as you sweat out\
  \ a lot. Al Wahda mall was very close to my house and why I liked it was because\
  \ they had LuLu in the basement where we used to get our groceries from. Abu Dhabi\
  \ mall was another one of my favourites because of their food court. Marina mall\
  \ was by the water. But let me warn you, they have a strict rule of no outside food\
  \ so don\u2019t pack any picnics if you are planning to go to a malls food court.\
  \ Some days I had some difficulty getting around as most of the people who work\
  \ in government offices only speak Arabic but if you know English, it helps. We\
  \ used to get bottled water once a week delivered to our house which was convenient\
  \ and since I had moved from Pakistan it was not new for me as the tap water wasn\u2019\
  t safe to drink there as well. I really enjoyed the night life there as we used\
  \ to pack food and go sit under the moon light at break water and relax while listening\
  \ to the soothing sounds of water. I am personally very fond of water and enjoy\
  \ being around it. Be it natural or artificial. Yas water world is an outdoor water\
  \ park with so much to do. Keep a whole day aside and still you may can only get\
  \ onto each slide only once. And if you want to explore natural water, then Atlantis\
  \ was a place for me to be. Beautifully surrounded by water, a whole world in itself,\
  \ including acquariums and high end hotel, Atlantis is a tourism spot where one\
  \ can soothe all their senses. Talking about high end hotels, Emirates Palace gives\
  \ you a royal feeling. Tall, high pillars and roofs with exclusive architecture\
  \ and bright lighting will give you a feeling of being a royalty. UAE is famous\
  \ for having the biggest and the tallest. Sure enough Sheikh Zayed Mosque is a huge\
  \ one. They have the longest running carpet in the prayer hall which is very artistically\
  \ done. \nI have seen Abu Dhabi both by a travellers eye and a local resident and\
  \ I can say that \u201Cthings to do\u201D on google can be helpful, but confusing.\
  \ It was hard to leave as Abu Dhabi was so close to home, only a 2.5 hour flight,\
  \ but I love adventures so I allow life to take me to new places. The universe helped\
  \ me move to Canada and I absolutely love it here. I often go to US too but I\u2019\
  ll always remember my journey in Abu Dhabi. That was my honeymoon period."
