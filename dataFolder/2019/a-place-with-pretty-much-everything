Text: "Santiago, the capital of Chile in south america, is a big modern city with\
  \ streets and constructions that tell its people's history, and the best thing about\
  \ the city, about Chile actually, is that it doesn't matter what kind of vacations\
  \ you prefer, you will find amazing things to see and do. \n   I was amazed while\
  \ walking the streets in Santiago, beautiful churches and historical buildings,\
  \ a variety of places to stop and eat and then keep on walking. The city has a great\
  \ transportation system with buses,taxis and the subway, but it is made for you\
  \ to just walk around. Some parts in the central area make you feel like you are\
  \ in Ireland or something, old Europe, and then out of the blue you are standing\
  \ in front of an American trending shop or cafe. There are many things to highlight\
  \ here but I will select some itens:\n- Cerro San Crist\xF3bal: I loved it there,\
  \ going to the highest point of the city by cable car, a first for me, and seeing\
  \ the sun heating up the summer days in a town surrounded by snowy montains, the\
  \ Andes. It is gorgeous, photographic and silent, and despite of the tourists there,\
  \ people pray, meditate or just contemplate life there. \n- Las Condes: if you want\
  \ to go fancy, this is where you need to be. Modern buildings share space with parks\
  \ and green areas that are cleaner than you house, art exhibitions and a shopping\
  \ center with diamonds hanging from the ceiling. I felt rich just visiting there,\
  \ very cosmopolitan. \n- Vin\xE3 Del Mar: I went there in the spur of the moment\
  \ and it is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. A place where\
  \ you don't see street lights, you see flowers instead. The whole city is decorated\
  \ with flowers to remind you that nature is a privilege, but it is difficult to\
  \ forget that when you are sided with and incredible view of the pacific ocean,\
  \ pelicans flying near miniature castle like buildings and again, white and clear\
  \ sand that invites you to swim in it, but surely, everyone prefers the sea\n  \
  \   One thing that called my attention though, and there are many things that did,\
  \ is how much Chilean people care for animals on the streets. Chile does not have\
  \ stray dogs, they have dogs, everyone takes care of dogs running free everyone,\
  \ people leave bowls of water and food in front of the stores and houses. People\
  \ pet them while out and about, they are these big groomed dogs. Everybody does\
  \ a little and things just work. \n    I have a friend who lives in Santiago and\
  \ he took me on a private tour of La Moneda, the government palace, but there are\
  \ visit tours every day, if you know something about history in Latin America, you\
  \ have to go there.\n    There are places I did not visit, this is the thing, you\
  \ don't go to Chile once, you have to return, I know I will."
