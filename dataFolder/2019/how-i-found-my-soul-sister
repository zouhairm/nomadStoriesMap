Text: "Nine Years ago i met my soul sister on the other side of the word and it has\
  \ changed my life forever. How you might ask? Let me explain. \n\nNine years ago\
  \ I had just graduated from high school and I decided that I wanted to do an academic\
  \ exchange year in America. I have always felt drawn to American culture and English\
  \ as a language. I was going to live with an exchange family for my academic year\
  \ and the program I was traveling with let the familys pick their exchange students.\
  \ Call it whatever you want but I will call it fate, because my exchange family\
  \ already had accepted another exchange student from Germany. Something didn\u2019\
  t work out and they needed to look for a new exchange student.  With only knowing\
  \ that I was also German and a girl, they decided to accept me. We did not know\
  \ anything about each other, but when my host mom picked me up from the airport\
  \ I immediately felt welcomed. Shortly after I even felt like a member of this family.\
  \ I do have to say it took me a while to understand everyone because accents are\
  \ different once you actually are in a country compared to what you learn in school.\
  \ Who would have thought!  This family also had a daughter in my age that I was\
  \ going to share a room with. I think we where just made of the same kind of crazy\
  \ because it didn\u2019t even take us a day to get used to each other. We even started\
  \ sharing clothes and a bed after just a couple of days. We also owned similar clothes\
  \ and found out we hat a lot more in common than that. We had and still have such\
  \ a strong connection that we even considered having been siblings in another life.\
  \ This might sound crazy to some people but our life\u2019s always seem to be connected\
  \ in some way. This year she is actually going to get married and I am proud to\
  \ say that I will be her maid of honor. I know that this is supposed to be a travel\
  \ story but this is exactly what can happen when you put yourself out in the world.\
  \ You never know what can happen, but it is almost always something positive.  You\
  \ might find a friend or a second family for life. But even if you don\u2019t you\
  \ will gain a bigger understanding of yourself and the world, you will become more\
  \ mature and you will not be laying on your deathbed thinking I wish I did that.\
  \ You will be thinking I am glad I did that !"
