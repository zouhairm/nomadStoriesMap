Text: "Kenya is an extraordinary country, filled with beautiful people, amazing sights\
  \ and unique food. I had the pleasure of spending a few days in the coastal town\
  \ Malindi, and the remaining ten days in the capital city, Nairobi. Since I was\
  \ a young girl, travelling to Africa has been a dream of mine, specifically visiting\
  \ orphanages, slums, etc. Basically what I saw in the world vision commercials,\
  \ I wanted to experience first hand, and I wanted to help. I had that pleasure in\
  \ 2016 with a group of fourteen friends, on the very first day on the ground we\
  \ visited Happy Life Children\u2019s orphanage. It was everything I hoped it would\
  \ be, holding babies, playing games with kids, feeding infants. We laughed, we cried,\
  \ we blessed and were exceedingly blessed ourselves. We had a very well planned\
  \ itinerary with very little downtime, but my hope was to visit the orphanage once\
  \ more. Thankfully that opportunity arose, on one of our last days in Kenya, after\
  \ supper. We arrived at the orphanage just in time to help get the infants fed and\
  \ tucked into their cribs. I was handed Betty first, a sweet 3 month old girl, who\
  \ sleepily drank her formula in my arms. As I fed Betty, one of the orphanage workers\
  \ told me they picked up a new infant that morning at the hospital, he had been\
  \ abandoned there by his mother. I asked how old he was and she said they were uncertain\
  \ but thought he was perhaps 2 or 3 weeks old. I asked what his name was, and I\
  \ was shocked to find out he had no name. The worker explained they very rarely\
  \ find out their given names, and therefore they have to name the children themselves.\
  \ I placed Betty into her crib, and was handed the newest orphan, with no name.\
  \ I snuggled him close and kissed his forehead, what a precious baby boy. The worker\
  \ laughed at this, saying I must love him. I continued to cuddle the sweet bundle,\
  \ when the girl spoke, \u201Cyou can name him.\u201D I couldn\u2019t believe it.\
  \ You want me to name him? I said, really name him? She laughed again, yes, you\
  \ love him, you name him. It felt like such a huge task, giving someone their name?!\
  \ We all began talking about names, and I read over the list of names the other\
  \ infants had, surprised that most were traditional names like Peter and Isaac.\
  \ I finally decided on the name \u201CAdam\u201D which I had been told, my name\
  \ would have been had I been a boy. The worker agreed it was a nice name, and she\
  \ wrote it in chalk with the other names. I held baby Adam until it was time for\
  \ us to leave. I cried when I tucked him into his crib. Naming a child was never\
  \ part of my dream, but looking back, it is my fondest memory from that trip. I\
  \ left a piece of my heart in that beautiful country, at Happy Life Orphanage, with\
  \ Adam."
