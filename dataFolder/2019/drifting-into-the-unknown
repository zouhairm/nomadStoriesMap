Text: "There are a few things in this world that can make an adult chuckle like a\
  \ child. For instance, taking flight for the first time and restraining happy screams,\
  \ so it appears normal to everyone else onboard the plane. \nThis was how my journey\
  \ to the roof of the world, Aka, The Himalayas, began. I was a child again. Unexpectedly,\
  \ these instances of chuckle and childlike joy were lined up one behind another\
  \ for six consecutive days. Maybe it was just the universe helping discover the\
  \ unknown in all its heart.\n Pushed back into my seat by the massive torque of\
  \ the flight, I still held on to my smile as I looked out the window. The tremendously\
  \ huge metal box that weighed tons had lifted off to the horizon to open up one\
  \ of the most beautifully lit sights of my own city in a way I never saw before.\n\
  \nBefore I knew, I had covered almost the entire central longitude of my country\
  \ to land at the foothills of the Himalayas. I was there for my first high altitude\
  \ trek through Hampta Pass at an altitude of 4270 m, in inner Himachal. I rendezvoused\
  \ with co travelers; my cousin and twenty other folks from around the country and\
  \ even the other side of the world, at Manali. \nFrom here, making friends with\
  \ strangers, we marshaled up in 4X4s to reach our base camp at \u2018Jobra\u2019\
  \ for our seven day trek. \n\nWhat started off as a jovial walk in a the pinewood\
  \ clad forest and vast open meadows on the first day of the trek from Jobra, eventually\
  \ began to be one of the most adventurous and perilous journeys that would take\
  \ us to the top of the world. In a place this serene, it\u2019s hard not to behold\
  \ the most abstract, subtle and intense forces of nature amidst the chirps of my\
  \ fellow breathless trekkers.\nAs we walked along capturing moments to hold in our\
  \ hearts forever, our guide enlightened us about the trail we took.\n Shepherds\
  \ have used these hardly treadable paths for centuries to find greener pastures\
  \ in the higher altitude grasslands of Lahaul, about 50km away from where we stood.\
  \ \n As we gained altitude steadily for two days, the green meadows and flora faded\
  \ to give way to a desert like setting with barren lands, massive monoliths and\
  \  far away glaciers. Other than mountain goats, some rare birds and us humans,\
  \ the place didn\u2019t seem like a habitat for life. \nThe days here echoed with\
  \ the magnificence of the limitless Pir Panjal range and the fresh streams of water\
  \ running down from its glaciers. The nights were another story. It felt like the\
  \ fierce winds, the dreadful cold and the endless covering of mist kept reassuring\
  \ us that we didn\u2019t belong there.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the camaraderie among\
  \ us trekkers, we were sure to return back.\nThankfully, we didn\u2019t. The next\
  \ couple of days encompassed the most awe striking places on earth I have ever witnessed.\
  \ Chandratal (moonlake) and Shea Goru (the beach in the mountains) did all justice\
  \ to its name.\nThe challenge we were faced with to reach these places was ascending\
  \ and descending 2500ft to crossing the Hampta Pass. Most of us, were even thankful\
  \ to return from here. Mostly on the walking along the edge of the mountain, a look\
  \ down, sent shivers down the spines. \nJust so as we carefully treaded along watching\
  \ our footsteps the entire valley was compelled into a moment of silence. An enormous\
  \ explosion of a huge piece of the mountain crashing to the ground did us.\nThankfully\
  \ for us we had survived the rock and survived Hampta Pass, a trek that is known\
  \ to have killed at least hundreds.\nWith a deep regard for the wild Himalayas,\
  \ we did find love in what we sought.\n\nimagery\nSo abstract, yet so complete,\n\
  the sound of every tiny droplet rushing down the streams\nthe thundering of the\
  \ mountain that fell to its knees, \nthe ferocity of the breeze, ever so cold\n\
  the warmth of the tiny birds, chirping tales untold \nOur silent footsteps took\
  \ us in to a secret world unknown to the people outside."
