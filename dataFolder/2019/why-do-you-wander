Text: "My story brings the perspective of someone who travels the world and \u2018\
  blends\u2019 in to experience a city through the eyes of a local. In a time when\
  \ travel has become relatively easy, most people journey long distances to see monuments\
  \ and sights or to get away from their everyday lives. I have been guilty of this.\
  \ I have travelled far distances just to experience the nightlife in major European\
  \ cities. I can tell you the most popular nightclubs from Ibiza to Larnaca. My intention\
  \ in Greece last summer was to have a blast and live to tell of my escapades, but\
  \ my experience in this beautiful country of many islands completely altered my\
  \ purpose for traveling. I cannot exactly tell you when or how but I found my interests\
  \ drifting away from the cocktails and hangovers towards observing the social interaction\
  \ among the Greek people, their epic history and their outlook on life. I started\
  \ to have meaningful conversations rather than assumptions and despite the obvious\
  \ language barrier, certain things I had been oblivious to became quite apparent.\
  \ I am a US Army veteran and I had no knowledge of a military base in Crete till\
  \ I was informed by some locals. I even debunked my own myth of Greek people being\
  \ good old coffee worshippers who loved to party. I came to understand that coffee\
  \ is what the Greek people bond over. Just like the Arabs, Indians and the English\
  \ bond over tea. The typical time spent by a group of friends drinking coffee in\
  \ a caf\xE9 was two to three hours (I had a few of those sessions myself). Every\
  \ Greek friend I made invited me for coffee first before the notion of having a\
  \ beer even came up. Very much unlike my German friends who invited me for a proper\
  \ Hefeweizen within the first five minutes of meeting them. \n\nIn the end, I left\
  \ Greece with an entirely different perspective and making friends that I feel will\
  \ last a lifetime. I have even been back to visit the friends I made there. I have\
  \ been privileged to visit a lot of places before and meet a lot of people; most\
  \ of which I probably will never see again since we were all just doing the typical\
  \ tourist stuff or looking forward to the next day's hangover. Not to say I no longer\
  \ enjoy a cocktail or ten on vacation nights but I seem to be partying more with\
  \ the locals albeit learning about them at the same time wherever I find myself\
  \ these days.\n\nI wish I could describe the feeling of finding a new and true dimension\
  \ to traveling. For me that is experiencing another culture; the essence of human\
  \ interaction. To my very good friend who once asked me \"why do you wander?\",\
  \ I have found a right reason to. I asked myself what I was looking for once before\
  \ but now I know it is definitely not a phantom. If I wander with the intention\
  \ of seeing more than monuments and having a blast around the world, maybe I would\
  \ have better stories to tell. With the world getting smaller everyday, maybe my\
  \ skill at bridging cultural gaps will improve. I have made it a point to make a\
  \ local connection everywhere I go and its made traveling so much more enjoyable.\
  \ It makes the torture of flying so much more worth it for me.\n\nI have a much\
  \ longer story to tell on my experience in Greece and places afterwards but my message\
  \ here is, if you are still in your comfort zone questioning why you should wander,\
  \ Frodo Baggins said \"home is behind, the world ahead.\" You should truly see the\
  \ world and meet its people. And if you already took that leap, why do you wander?"
