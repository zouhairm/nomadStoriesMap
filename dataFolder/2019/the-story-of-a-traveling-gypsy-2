Text: "Traveling can offer so much history to a town and it's founders. Ive always\
  \ had a taste for adventure and the will to see the world before I put the last\
  \ nail in my coffin. \nI've never been out of the U.S before and only had been to\
  \ a few of the states but I took a week and travel from my hometown in Florida,\
  \ up the east coast to Washington D.C. \nIn college I loved history, and learning\
  \ about the nooks and hidden knowledge I could find not just in books but in person.\
  \ \nAlong the way I stoped in little towns to see their historic districts, parks,\
  \ maybe someone a famous person once passed through. I enjoy the little things,\
  \ they make the road trip more with your while. Now I love photography and writing\
  \ and the trip really inspired me to capture and journal about all the things I\
  \ see and my emotions. \nAs I reached my destination just outside of Gettysburg\
  \ PA, I took the metro into D.C and I realized how small I was compared to the building\
  \ and monuments and it became clear to me that that was going to be exciting. \n\
  Now if you ever make a plan to visit or if you already have been, I recommend the\
  \ Natural History Museum as a Top 5 to visit first. I lived inside and made sure\
  \ I took in everything that was around me.  \nI was mesmerized by all the different\
  \ exhibits in one place, that it almost felt like you traveled many places but within\
  \ a few steps of each other. The photography,crystal and marine sciences exibits\
  \ were extraordinary to experience.\n\nThe days were hot, not much wind made its\
  \ way inside the paths of the city, but the colors were vivid, the people were kind\
  \ always selling cold drinks for passerbys, ask you where your from and you can\
  \ learn a variety of things about someone in a breif conversation. \nFood trucks,\
  \ and mobile reaturants are a huge trend in D.C, very busy city so you can just\
  \ grab and go, now this was an experience, again the small things, my hometown we\
  \ have ice cream and food trucks on the beach and for big events but they were all\
  \ over, seemed to hard to find an even sit in restaurant in the area. I liked the\
  \ idea though, you can grab what you want sit in the parks near the Washinton Monument\
  \ and take everything in around you and see things from a different perspective\
  \ and not be surrounded by four walls. \nIf your a picture lover like me, then induldge\
  \ in taking selfies in front of the Lincoln Memorial or the giant Cathedrals in\
  \ the square which are pleasing if your also an architecture admirer. \nOne of my\
  \ other favorite adventures was visiting the art galleries. \nI was an art major\
  \ in College and took a class on the history of renaissance images and painting\
  \ and devolped a love for a variety of art work. \nThe Smithsonian is a big place\
  \ and I was sad to not had enough time to see every little thing the city had to\
  \ offer. \nAs you travel you realize there is never enough time in the world especially\
  \ when its your first time to a place. \nI witnessed street performers, street names\
  \ I've never seen, statutes of all kinds scattered where there history remains.\
  \ \nLast but not least I stood infront the White House and was lost in a train of\
  \ thought, the place where all our presidents once resided, the place that had been\
  \ in books, on the news, in movies, documentary's and all the places it came into\
  \ as I was growing up, it may not be the Northern Lights or the Effiel Tower but\
  \ there is a huge price of time right here in our own country. \nAs I began to travel\
  \ more I learned and experienced that every little town or state has a story behind\
  \ even if its not the ideal destination. \nThe little things you find along the\
  \ way are what's worth holding onto. \nThat's why my dream is to travel the world\
  \ and share my adventures."
