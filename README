Goal of this project is to do something cool with travel writing stories submitted to world nomad.

These are the main features to be implemented:

1) Scrape the data from the website
2) Train a system to represent the stories (such as word2Vec or doc2Vec)
3) ???
4) Profit!

Some options for 3:
* Build a classifier and a way to explore the corpus of stories. Perhaps associate each cluster with some images (pulled from Web?)

* Come up with one sentence summaries for each of the stories? Is there such a thing as an SVD for that?

* Generate new stories based on a "seed"?
